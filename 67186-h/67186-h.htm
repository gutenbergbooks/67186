<h2 id='chP' title='Prologue: He Rides by Night'>
<span style='font-size:larger;'>THE RIDER OF THE MOHAVE</span><br /><br />
PROLOGUE—HE RIDES BY NIGHT</h2>

<p>It was three in the morning, but Geerusalem had
not yet closed its eyes. There was too much
undug gold in the hills; it was too handy—too
easy come, easy go; the days, too short; the pleasures,
too wanton, too alluring. The camp of Geerusalem
promenaded, gambled, danced, fought, debauched
the night away, waiting for to-morrow.
Far out on desolate Soapweed Plains, rose the intermittent,
yelping wail-bark of a coyote.</p>

<p>The back door of a little store that fronted on
the main street opened cautiously. The interior of
what was a kitchen was dark; the flower-garden
yard into which it gave, was also dark. The
shadowy form of a man emerged and halted; he
peered carefully about through the gloom. A
smaller figure followed, pausing on the threshold—a
woman, her white apron and snowy hair quite
visible. The man turned, took her in his arms
impulsively, and held her close to his breast.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, ma. I’ll be droppin’ round
again, two weeks from to-night—sure’s sic ’em!”
he whispered, as he kissed her.</p>

<p>The woman wept softly. “Oh, Jerome, darling,
why don’t you quit this awful thing?” she sobbed,
clinging to him. “Don’t you know how my heart’s
just breaking?”</p>

<p>“Too late, ma. I oughter’ve quit ’fore I begun.
If I started quittin’ now, they wouldn’t let me,
would they? But I’m tellin’ you; don’t think about
me. They can’t ketch me. I’ve bin goin’ it three
years, ain’t I? Well, then, when you see Tinnemaha
Pete, tell him to leave you a chunk of that
ore. An’ see that he don’t tell nobody about findin’
it. I figger it’s a bonanza. Mebby, that’ll mean
better days. Well, we’ll see what’s doin’. Now,
I’d better be scootin’, honey. An’ don’t you worry,
see?” He kissed her again, tenderly, many times,
breathing his last injunction into her ear.</p>

<p>A few seconds later he had slipped like a
shadow across the yard and was stealing out of
an alleyway between two adobe buildings, heading
for the back street. That street was black, deserted,
the nocturnal population of the camp confining itself
to the bright lights and attractions that converted
the one business thoroughfare into a brilliant avenue,
noisy with ribald merrymaking and adventure.</p>

<p>Near by stood his horse. He reached it and, with
a vigilant glance about, threw back one of the
flaps of his saddlebags and plunged a rummaging
hand inside. It came forth with a folded piece of
wrapping paper and several nails he had placed
there the day before.</p>

<p>With a reckless chuckle, he wound his bandanna
around his face leaving only his eyes exposed; then
he mounted and rode off to the next cross street,
and thence to the brilliantly lighted hub of the
town. The bulletin board of the Geerusalem
<i>Searchlight</i>, an afternoon newspaper, loomed big
and black on the edge of the sidewalk, in the full
glare of window lights. It was one of those moments
when the immediate vicinity was clear of
promenaders.</p>

<p>Seeing this, the rider spurred over to the bulletin
board, unfolded the sheet of wrapping paper, and
nailed it on the black surface with the butt of
his six-shooter. Then, he caracoled his horse about,
fired a volley into the air and, throwing the whole
strength of his lungs into a wild howl, waved his
hat to a crowd of men standing before the Miners’
Hotel, and dashed away around the nearest street
corner, bound for the lonely, trailless reaches of
the Mohave Desert far to the south.</p>

<p>The horde of curious night revelers swarming to
the spot, a few seconds later, read with varying
degrees of emotion the rough printed notice on the
bulletin board:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bin lookin three year for Sheriff Warburton an cant
find him. Ill give $5,000 to git akquainted with the county
fameous detektive.</p>

<h2 title='I—Mania and Dreams' id='chI'>
  CHAPTER I—MANIA AND DREAMS
</h2>

<p>Lemuel Huntington had told himself a thousand
times that his Dot must have an education.
He had long since become infatuated with
the notion. It had him gripped as tenaciously as
the seductive toils of romance had the imaginative
Dot enmeshed. It was a consuming mania with
him.</p>

<p>“If I got to steal the money, she’s goin’ to college—the
dream of her darlin’ dead mother. S’help
me, I’ll turn thief if I got to!”</p>

<p>Lemuel, the failure, was fifty-one—the age when
most men begin to slow down, whether they want
to or not. Twenty years before, he and his little
bride had left a perfectly good living in Iowa to
try a short cut to fortune in California. The fact
that more often than not distance is a most captivating
beckoner, did not occur to these happy newlyweds
until they reached the Golden State and found
that a tremendous army—also seeking sudden
wealth—had preceded them, and was daily being
augmented by regiments of recruits from the four
corners of the globe.</p>

<p>The discovery appalled them—their capital being
alarmingly small; and nearly two years of drifting
from little town to little town, just managing to
get by, took the heart out of them.</p>

<p>Then, one day, Lemuel brought home news of a
tract of government land known as Soapweed
Plains, on the north rim of the Mohave Desert,
with enticing reports of rich mineral belts in the
adjacent mountain ranges. It looked like the opportunity
for which they had waited. They would
homestead, and in a few years Huntington would
be a name indelibly branded on the cattle industry
of the State. And there was the further golden
prospect of rich mines!</p>

<p>Packing their few belongings, husband and wife
bought tickets to the dismal wind-whipped station
of Mirage, on the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad,
and spent two everlasting days shooing a
trinity of stubborn burros over a hell waste, into
the new land of promise. But again the captivating
beckoner had tricked them. Soapweed Plains
was a sweltering realm of sagebrush, sand and
sidewinders, twenty-five miles wide, divided off
from the rest of the desert universe by a horseshoe
barricade of saw-edge peaks and table mountains
that abutted a sky-line mesa to the south—and by
serenading coyotes by night.</p>

<p>In despair, the Huntingtons filed on two quarter
sections of sand and rubble, the west side of their
claims overlapping a bunch-grass hill; the narrow
strip on the east was handy to those scant benefits
of irrigation so grudgingly bestowed by the tepid
disappearing-reappearing Mohave River. Here, at
least, they might coax a living out of the soil, said
Lemuel dolefully. It was a permanent anchorage,
if nothing more, sighed his wife. And they started
grubbing away a site for a home and killing the
sidewinding rattlesnakes.</p>

<p>Soon, they found that the potato thrived, as did
the melon and alfalfa; found, too, that it was a
paradise for bees. They contrived to get a cow
and heifer, a span of desert-broke horses, and a
rattletrap buckboard. Prospectors learned about the
Huntington ranch and, finding it handier to go there
after certain commodities than to far-off Mirage,
began patronizing it. Its popularity grew. As a
result, Lemuel added a stock of bacon, beans, condensed
milk, sugar, matches, and such staple supplies
to his assorted farm products, and reaped a
comfortable profit therefrom.</p>

<p>Then Dot came—and the lonely brush ranch became
the nucleus of Lemuel and Emily’s resurrected
hopes, for they began planning wonderful things for
their first-born, and, not the least among these
things, an education that would make her a great
lady of accomplishments some day.</p>

<p>But the years dragged by, one after the other,
in that out-of-the-way land, so woefully lacking in
transportation—empty-handed years almost, that
held out scarcely more than a possibility at any
time that those precious plans of theirs would ever
be fulfilled. It would take a fat purse indeed to
send Dot to select Longwell Seminary in San Francisco
and keep her there in becoming luxury until
she blossomed forth a chosen daughter of California’s
élite.</p>

<p>When Dot was twelve her brave little mother
died, and for a long time afterward, Lemuel went
about like a man desperately searching for something
he had lost without knowing just what it was.
His resurrected hopes died with her, and were
buried. Everything slowed down to a point where
he merely held on to a bare living for himself and
his child.</p>

<p>To-day, he was a failure, that child eighteen,
while the only remaining echo of the precious plans
to make Dot a grand lady was this secret wild
mania of his, seething in the core of his brain,
to see that daughter educated before they laid
him beside the trim little grave in the garden.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this same mania of his that now
led him to haunt the nearest place where brains
forgathered—the gold camp of Geerusalem, four
miles northeast of the Huntington ranch—and to
get to hobnobbing with its insolent brotherhood of
mining engineers, promoters, assayers, and attorneys—a
type of individual that looms up in the
mind of the crude Southwest as prodigious as totem
poles, omniscient and omnipotent.</p>

<p>Whatever it was that made Lemuel enjoy being
the butt of this uppish fraternity’s quips and sneers,
and come back regularly for more, hardly matters.
Month in and month out, as often as he could get
away from the ranch, he would saddle a horse and
ride to Geerusalem, and spend the day strutting
around with the forty-five caliber brains of the
camp. Accordingly, day after day, Dot, the imaginative,
was left to herself and the weaving of her
wistful, romantic dreams.</p>

<p>She was a bright little body, this eighteen-year-old
daughter of Lemuel, the failure; face so frank
and sensitive, hair so soft and wavy and glossy,
throat so round and smooth. Her eyes were large
and brown, and sometimes quite sad from gazing
too long into the monotonous distances out of
whose blue haze nothing of living substance ever
came. She had grown to charming young womanhood,
but she still retained the fanciful mind of her
pinafore days—the little story-teller had survived as
her playmate, Frank Norris would have said—with
all a youngster’s fascination for impossible stories
of impossible beings.</p>

<p>She would sit by the hour dreaming of handsome
blond heroes rescuing beautiful maidens from
the clutches of Tatarian villains, with wicked flowing
black mustaches and bushy eyebrows, of magnificent
daredevil bandits succoring helpless widows
and orphans, of notorious Billy Gee even, about
whose wild, desperate exploits up and down the
Mohave and Colorado Deserts she had heard so
much, of hairbreadth escapes, furious bloody duels,
and brilliant weddings.</p>

<p>The isolated ranch was an ideal spot for the
painting of just such thrilling mind pictures. She
could sit on the front porch and look across the
gray desolation of plain that stretched to the violet
and yellow scallop of range twenty miles eastward,
and visualize in that void of undulating air currents
every scene her fertile imagination conjured
up for her. She lived those scenes, every one of
them. They were big moments in her life; palpitating,
vivid moments—moments that made her dreary,
humdrum existence worth while to her.</p>

<p>“Nothing ever happens out here,” she would
sometimes murmur to the eternal sameness of the
plains. “Nobody ever comes this way, even. I
wish daddy would sell the ranch and move to Geerusalem
or somewhere—where things happen,
where people laugh and talk and visit.”</p>

<p>On a number of occasions, Lemuel had found
her sitting on the front porch, musing into the
solitudes, eyes brilliant, cheeks aglow, her parted
lips moving.</p>

<p>“Gosh, what a pity!” he had lamented to himself
each time, as he went tiptoeing away. “It’s
them fine brains of hers workin’. I tell you, Em’ly,
wife, she’s goin’ to be the great lady you figgered
on, if I got to sell my soul to do it. I’m jest
watchin’ for a chanct. You wait an’ see!”</p>

<p class='mt10'>It was well on toward noon of an August day.
A fiery sun was churning the floor of Soapweed
Plains into a stormy ocean of heat waves. Lemuel
had gone to Geerusalem on his customary hobnobbing
expedition. Dot, her housework completed,
sat reading in the shade of the passion-flower vine
that trellised the porch, a novel borrowed from
Mrs. Agatha Liggs, a widow who kept a small
dry goods store in the camp.</p>

<p>Suddenly, breaking on the dead silence like
muffled shots, came the sound of hoofs. Dot dropped
her book and sprang to her feet expectantly, for
the riders who passed that way, bound to and from
the unimportant desert station of Mirage, were few
indeed and far between. The next instant she was
staring at a lone horseman approaching, not along
the road but from across country, from the direction
of the violet and yellow scallop of range that
formed the magical setting of all her romantic
dreams!</p>

<p>She stared in unbelief, amazed for the moment.
Then she noticed that he was hatless, that the
whole side of his head, the whole front of his
dirty, white shirt, were crimson with blood, that
he reeled drunkenly, lifelessly in the saddle.</p>

<p>Aghast at the spectacle, she gazed on, rooted to
the spot, until the exhausted horse stumbled up to
the barred gate and stopped, drooping, rocking on
quivering legs. Out of the gate she darted then,
threw down the bars and led the animal up to the
house, her heart fluttering with excitement and
horror.</p>

<p>The rider was in a half swoon, mumbling thickly.
Above his right ear was a long, bloody furrow,
like the plow of a bullet. The bandanna he had
had for a bandage had slipped down over his face,
neglected. It was saturated. He had been bleeding
for hours, was her horrifying thought. A glance
told her that he was a stranger. That same glance
informed her that he was probably twenty-five,
fairly good-looking even through his coating of dust
and blood, and that he wore a double cartridge
belt and a brace of six-shooters, one of which he
still held gripped in his hand.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, she would have been quite unable to
handle the dead weight he represented, but now
she managed to drag him out of the saddle and
into the house without being particularly conscious
of the effort. She got him on the parlor lounge
finally and plunged into the work of bathing his
wound and dressing it. Then she tore away his
sodden shirts, replaced them with two of her
father’s, and brought a dipper of water and poured
it in little swallows down his throat.</p>

<p>Seating herself in a chair beside him, she looked
him over curiously, studied him. Who was he?
What was he? The wound? Under less shocking
circumstances, it was quite probable he would have
proved a big treat to her vivid imagination. But
now there somehow seemed to be too much tragic
reality about him to make her care to commit him
and his plight to the wild flings of fancy.</p>

<p>At last he opened his eyes and stared up at her
vaguely. They were blue eyes. There was an odd,
hunted glint in them, a smolder of recklessness, a
shadow of sadness, exhaustion. He raised an uncertain
hand to his bandaged head. He glanced
around the room, then back at her, his wits clearing suddenly.</p>

<p>“Where am I? Whose—whose place is this?” he
jerked out, with an effort.</p>

<p>“This is Lemuel Huntington’s ranch. I’m his
daughter, Dot.” She thought a queer interest
leaped into his eyes at the information. “You must
be quiet, now. You’ve lost a lot of blood, but
you’ll be all right,” she went on, when he did not
speak. “If I fixed you something, could you eat?”
She rose from her chair.</p>

<p>But he detained her, in a sudden spasm of apprehension.
“My—my saddlebags! I—they——”
he faltered hoarsely.</p>

<p>“They’re safe outside,” she nodded. “Do you
want them?”</p>

<p>“Please, sister. Bring ’em here. Hurry! I—I
want ’em handy.”</p>

<p>She ran out of the front door to the horse which
still stood, untethered, on sagging legs. Unfastening
the leather containers, she carried them into the
house. She remarked that while they were not
especially heavy, they bulged to capacity, their flaps
buckled securely. She remarked also the man’s relief
at sight of them and how profusely he thanked
her. Then he instructed her to stow them under
the head of the lounge and asked her for a drink of
water. But when she returned with a dipperful,
she found him sunk into a sleep of exhaustion.
Whereupon she darkened the room, closed the door
quietly behind her, and went outside again to look
after the spent horse.</p>

<p>Watering the animal, she tied it in a stall in the
barn to feed. Then she inspected the stranger’s saddle
carefully. It was typical of the parts, without
an identifying mark of any kind upon it, except
splashes of dried blood. Presently she fastened the
barn door and reëntered the house. Her mysterious
patient still slept. It was a few minutes past noon,
and she sat down to her customary warmed-over
meal in the kitchen, but she could not eat.</p>

<h2 title='II—The Man Hunter' id='chII'>
  CHAPTER II—THE MAN HUNTER
</h2>

<p>As has been said, Dot Huntington was, notwithstanding
her eighteen years, a child of romance.
She had been “living scenes” ever since her mother
told her the first bed-time story in the long, long
ago. She had wished so many, many times in the
past that something really thrilling might happen to
her—a big, exciting adventure. At this moment she
felt that that thrilling something had at last happened.
Here was that big, exciting adventure begun.
It was all like one of her tremendous, wonderful
dreams come true.</p>

<p>She quivered rapturously in the realization that
she was a flesh-and-blood factor in some great
tragic mystery, that, hero or villain, this sick,
wounded man was her patient, dependent on her.
A surge of pity swept suddenly into her heart at
the thought; an odd sense of responsibility followed,
bringing with it a subtle gratification she
keenly welcomed.</p>

<p>She told herself that this stranger had ridden in
out of that vast mystic horizon where all her
dreams had taken shape—like any one of the impossible
beings she visualized—looking for attention,
care, succor. Yes, she would heed his call—whether
he was good or bad. Why, indeed, should
she question the moral status of a man half dead?
She sat for a long time, her warmed-over meal
cold, ruminating thus. How he must have suffered
out in that awful wilderness of sand and furnace
heat!</p>

<p>Then again came the sound of approaching hoofs.</p>

<p>Starting up out of her chair, she listened. It
was the gait of a fresh horse. If it were her
father returning early from camp? If it were somebody
else? She had not given this phase of the
matter a thought. She had lost sight of embarrassing
consequences developing. Now vague fears she
could not analyze began to assail her.</p>

<p>The hoofs had fallen into a trot, had come to a
halt out on the road, ere she flitted through the
house, reached the front door and peered cautiously
out. A man had just dismounted at the gate. He
also was a stranger, a big, broad man about fifty,
wearing a split-crown sombrero, unusually wide of
brim, and baggy trousers stuffed into high-heeled
boots. He too was coated with the dust of long
riding, his iron-gray mustache almost invisibly
white with it, his six-shooter holsters standing out
from his hips.</p>

<p>In the act of lowering the bars, he stooped to
examine something on the ground. His appearance,
coupled with this last suspicious move, sufficed
to stamp him an officer of the law, even though
he was not wearing his identifying star of authority.</p>

<p>Dot watched him a few seconds, reasoning that
were he an officer, he undoubtedly hailed from San
Buenaventura, the county seat, as she was well acquainted
with the constable and deputy sheriffs
who made their headquarters in Geerusalem. With
this decision, she closed the door, locked it, and
rushed into the parlor. Her patient was sleeping
heavily. She shook him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Wake up! Wake up! There’s a—a sheriff outside!”
she whispered hoarsely into his ear.</p>

<p>He scrambled off the lounge in a panic, wild-eyed,
groggy, a curse bursting from his lips.</p>

<p>“Y’sure? Why in hell——&#160;Git back, an’ let
me at him! I’ll give him——” He fumbled feebly
for his six-shooters, reeled off his balance, and
tumbled over backward on the lounge. His gaze
fastened on her, horrible with appeal. “You
wouldn’t feed me to that buzzard—this way—would
you, sister? Gimme an even break with
the——” he gasped out.</p>

<p>A strange ominous fire was playing in Dot’s eyes.
She was pale, but dangerously calm. She leaned
over him and caught him quickly around the middle
with her right arm.</p>

<p>“Come! Stand up! He won’t dare go into my
room.”</p>

<p>He blundered to his feet, then through the small
dining room and into her own quarters, adjoining
the kitchen, she finally staggered with him and
helped him onto her bed.</p>

<p>“Not a sound, now!” she warned.</p>

<p>“I’ll never ferget you for this, Miss—Miss Huntington,”
he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>She closed the door after her as she went out,
locked it, and hurriedly arranged her appearance
before the wall glass in the kitchen. Then she
threw on a sunbonnet and took a glistening something
out of a drawer in the cupboard. She walked
out of the back door, just as the stranger, having
finished his investigations at the gate, approached
along the driveway, leading his horse. He touched
his hat to her as she came in view around the
corner of the house, one hand hidden in the folds
of her skirt.</p>

<p>“I jest dropped in to get a swaller of water for
Chain Lightnin’—if you don’t mind,” he said pleasantly.
“It’s right hot travelin’.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder. Help yourself.” She indicated
the trough near by. She looked him over,
with obvious suspicion.</p>

<p>While his horse drank, the visitor’s eyes wandered
apparently aimlessly over the vicinity; they
took in the girl, the buildings, the fresh hoofprints
in the mud around the trough. He even
hearkened to the munching of an animal in the
barn—hungry munching, that was. Presently he
sauntered back to her and halted a step away.</p>

<p>“You didn’t happen to see a feller ride by this
way an hour or so ago, miss? Mighta looked shot—bleedin’
bad?” he said, watching her narrowly.</p>

<p>She nodded. “About two hours ago—yes. Are
you——”</p>

<p>“By that you mean, he come an’ went—is
that it?”</p>

<p>“I said he <i>was</i> here, not he <i>is</i> here, sir,” she
parried, with emphasis.</p>

<p>He burst into a heavy chuckle, mopped his red
face, but kept his hawklike eye riveted on her. “I
see. Of course, if he was here you’d jest nacherly
out with it, sence they ain’t no reason why you
shouldn’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare! You’re awfully clever. You’ve
read my mind—almost,” she exclaimed, giving him
a radiant, tantalizing smile.</p>

<p>He winced and changed his tactics. When he
spoke again it was in a well-assumed, worried confidential
tone.</p>

<p>“Poor Bill! He bled like a stuck pig. I see it
out by the gate. Y’see, miss, me an’ him’s old
pals. He gets in a little scrimmich las’ night, an’
a depity sheriff whangs away at him. I bin’ tryin’
to ketch up with him sence about nine this mornin’.
I’m dead anxious to——”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” interrupted Dot. “Really, if I’d
known that, I’d have insisted on him waiting for
you.” He caught the sly derision in her voice, and
his jaws set.</p>

<p>“I see you got his hoss in the barn. I s’pose you
presented him with a fresh one an’ fixed him up
so’s he could go on comf’table?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes! I bandaged his head for him. That
was the Christian thing to do, don’t you think?
And that poor horse couldn’t have lasted him into
Geerusalem. But how in the world did you ever
guess——”</p>

<p>“How far is that?”</p>

<p>“Geerusalem? Four miles.”</p>

<p>“That’s about where he’s steerin’ for, don’t you
reckon?” he asked shrewdly.</p>

<p>She flashed him another smile. “That’s just what
I was going to ask you. How should I know his
business? Being his old pal, you’re doing a lot of
funny questioning, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>He flushed angrily. “You know consid’rable more
than you let on, miss,” he said harshly, his eyes
narrowing to pin points. “They ain’t no hoss went
out that gate sence he come in here. Somebody
ridden out before, but you helped this galoot outer
the saddle an’ tramped over the other tracks. You
can’t make no sucker outer me. Come through,
now!”</p>

<p>She laughed daringly. “There’s more than one
way of getting off this ranch—fast, stranger. I’ve
had bother enough with one scamp already, without
wasting breath on his partner.” She took a
sudden step away from him, and the hand she had
held concealed in the folds of her skirt came forth,
holding a revolver. “Travel! Get out and hunt
for your friend, before I give you a place to bandage!”</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of her action took him quite
by surprise. He gazed hard at her for a few
seconds, then he changed fronts with amazing
rapidity. He began to grin broadly.</p>

<p>“Of co’se, you don’t know who you’re talkin’ to,
miss, or you wouldn’t jerk a gun——”</p>

<p>“I’m talking to another scalawag. Are you traveling,
or do you want what the deputy sheriff gave
him?”</p>

<p>There was no doubting her earnestness. Firmness
of purpose was stamped on her face, shone
from her eyes. The man saw it.</p>

<p>“Why, I’m Sheriff Warburton, of San Buenaventura
County, young lady,” he said rather awkwardly.</p>

<p>Dot had been looking straight at him, hard, inimically.
Now, as he made known his identity, she
also changed front. She wavered suddenly, amazement,
pleasure, unbelief struggling across her face.
She lowered the revolver and broke into a musical
laugh.</p>

<p>“Sheriff Bob Warburton! Are you really?
Sheriff? I’m Lemuel Huntington’s daughter, Dot.”</p>

<p>His eyes flew wide open. A snort of astonishment
burst from him. His ruddy countenance expanded
into a great warm smile.</p>

<p>“Lem’s daughter!” he exploded. “Get away!
Well, I’ll be reediscongariconficated! Not that leetle
knee-high tike I seen in Jupiter—le’s see, how many
years ago was that? Well now, wouldn’t that bust
you!” He grabbed her hand. “An’ this is Lem’s
ranch, eh? Bless his heart! Where’s the good ol’
hoss thief?”</p>

<p>Presently she said: “Won’t you come inside,
Sheriff Warburton, and let me fix you a little bite?
You must be hungry——”</p>

<p>“By George! I jest hate to refuse that, Dot. I
sure am hungry, but I got to git along.” He
grinned slyly as he added: “My time’s all took up
chasin’ this pardner of mine who you was so horspitable
to.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. You’re liable to get shot gallivanting
over the plains without your star and telling
such awful whoppers to defenseless young women,”
she warned him, with mock gravity.</p>

<p>“I’m more liable to, wearin’ it an’ tellin’ the
truth, Dot. This galoot is a stick-up—bad clean
through. I hear he’s got folks in these parts an’
I figgered you might be—well, mebby his sister.
You’ll forgive my bein’ a leetle rough, Dot, but
I——”</p>

<p>“If you’ll forgive my taking care of a wounded
man and asking no questions, Sheriff Warburton.
You were quite correct about him not leaving by
the front gate. But there’s another gate in the
north corner of the field, opening on the road between
Geerusalem and Colony Town.”</p>

<p>“I was dead sure I was right. You can’t fool
me on hoss tracks, Dot. Well, I’m goin’ on into
Geerusalem first, to dig up a posse. Reckon I
might see Lem. Anyway, tell him I’m comin’ out
before I go back, to see how he’s behavin’ hisself.”</p>

<p>As he was riding out along the driveway he
turned in his saddle and grinned at her.</p>

<p>“You got too big a heart, Dot. If you’d a-hung
onto that pardner of mine, you’d ’a’ collected ten
thousand dollars reeward—cash down.” He tapped
the breast pocket of his corduroy coat as he spoke.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='III—In Which Wills Collide' id='chIII'>
  CHAPTER III—IN WHICH WILLS COLLIDE
</h2>

<p>For a long time after Sheriff Warburton rode
away, Dot followed him with her eyes. Not
until he was but a wisp of dust in the gray distance,
did she turn to reënter the house. She was
considerably shaken by the ordeal, relieved that it
was over. Ten thousand dollars reward, he had
said. A fortune! What a store of untold pleasures
it would buy—surcease of worry, regeneration!
Thoughtfully she walked to her room and
unlocked the door. The fearful eyes of the fugitive
fastened on hers questioningly.</p>

<p>“He’s gone. It was Sheriff Warburton. He’s
hunting for you—to arrest you.” She said this in
quiet tones.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know how to thank you, Miss Huntington,”
he stammered huskily. “My—my own
mother couldn’t ’a’ done more. I ain’t deservin’.
I’m no good. I’ll never ferget you as long as I
live.” A strange spasm crossed his face. He settled
feebly back on the bed, the tears coursing down his
cheeks in little rivulets.</p>

<p>“There now! Don’t think about it,” she said
gently. “I’ll fix you something to eat. Then you
can sleep. But my father must not even suspect
that you are here, understand? To-night, when
you’re stronger, I’ll help you out of the house. I’ll
spread a few blankets in the hayloft for you. You’ll
be safe there.”</p>

<p>She made to leave the room, but he stopped her.</p>

<p>“Would you mind gettin’ me them—them saddlebags
ag’in, Miss Huntington? An’—an’ keep ’em
by me, won’t you? I got things in ’em I—I can’t
afford to lose, so to speak.”</p>

<p>For the second time Dot obeyed his request, bringing
the bulging twin leather pouches from under
the parlor lounge and storing them under the head
of the bed. Now, she began to wonder curiously
what they contained. While she prepared him his
meal she still wondered. Of a sudden it dawned
on her that in her nervousness and excitement she
had forgotten to ask Sheriff Warburton about the
fugitive—who he was, the nature of his crime,
everything. What if she should be harboring a
murderer? The thought chilled the blood in her
veins. It filled her with apprehension, misgivings—horrified
her. She turned it over in her mind, deciding
finally that she would not allow herself to
believe it. He was not the type who would kill
a man, of that she became firmly convinced. A
murderer must have something of viciousness
stamped on his face, she fancied. The result of
these reflections made her resolve to ask her patient
about himself. There was no great hurry. He
could not leave inside of several days anyway.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon she gathered together a number
of old blankets and quilts, and spread a bed for
the wounded fugitive in an obscure corner of the
hayloft under the eaves of the barn. She hid the
blood-spattered saddle. Then she drove the exhausted
horse to wander with their handful of
stock in the far end of the field.</p>

<p>Around five o’clock she made out her father galloping
home along the road from camp. Giving
the outlaw a few specific instructions she ran out
beyond the gate to meet Lemuel as was her custom.
But Huntington had no smile for his daughter
to-day. She marked the ill humor in his face,
the hard, accusing look he gave her, and half
suspected the reason.</p>

<p>A tall, angular, wiry man was Lemuel Huntington,
a sprinkle of gray in his hair and mustache,
a countenance more pathetic than aggressive. Association
with Geerusalem’s uppish fraternity had inspired
him to assume its dashy swagger garb—stiff-brim
gray Stetson, corduroy suit, his trousers
stuffed into yellow, laced, three-quarter boots resplendent
with steel buckles, his coat, box-pleated
and belted à la Norfolk. Just now, as he rode up,
scowling on Dot, he looked more the prosperous
mining man of sectional influence than the humble,
unimportant rancher he really was.</p>

<p>“What’s this talk of you side-kickin’ it with a
bandit, Dot?” he began sharply as he dismounted.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve met Sheriff Warburton, and
he’s told you——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. He says you helped Billy Gee git
away, patched him up, give him a hoss, an’——”</p>

<p>“Billy Gee!” she gasped aloud. Her patient was
the notorious desperado who, for years, had terrorized
the border settlements far to the south!</p>

<p>“Yes—Billy Gee. He stuck up the paymaster’s
car of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern last night at a
gradin’ camp east of Mirage an’ skinned out with
twenty thousand dollars. Bob Warburton was on
his trail when he done it. Posses are out thicker’n
fleas—three from Geerusalem alone. The country’s
all riled up. What d’you mean by actin’ that fool
way, Dot? Ain’t you got no sense?”</p>

<p>“How did I know he was Billy Gee, daddy?
Please be a little reasonable.” She spoke, a tinge
of impatience in her voice, her eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>“He must ’a’ acted suspicious, didn’t he? An’
he was winged, to boot.”</p>

<p>“He was about dead. Father, would you have me
run a dying man off the place, brutally—like a
dog? Is that the kind of daughter you want to be
proud of?” She was looking steadily at him now.</p>

<p>Lemuel was silent a moment. He glanced down
at the buckles on his boots.</p>

<p>“By gosh, honey! I reckon you’ve got the ol’
man holed up,” he admitted rather ruefully. “But
can’t you see, if it’d bin any one else, ’cept Bob
Warburton, we’d have a tough time provin’ we
wasn’t in cahoots with this thievin’ kiyote. It’s
mighty ticklish business, I’m tellin’ you. He was
bad hit, eh?”</p>

<p>She gave him a detailed account of the fugitive’s
arrival at the ranch, but very carefully omitted to
mention that she had taken him into the house.
Adroitly, also, she evaded saying that he had departed.
She dwelt in particular on the seriousness
of his condition because of his loss of blood and
his need of immediate care. Lemuel said no more
following this explanation, though it was quite
plain to her that some thought still troubled him.</p>

<p>While he attended to his chores Dot went into
the kitchen and started getting supper ready. Now
she was afire with excitement. Billy Gee, that terrible
personage of whom she had heard such wild,
thrilling things, was locked in her room—lying on
her bed! <i>Her</i> prisoner! Her romantic brain reeled
with ecstasy at the realization. And Sheriff Warburton,
posses galore, were frantically beating brush
the length and breadth of Soapweed Plains for Billy
Gee, in pursuit of a ten-thousand-dollar reward.
She had outwitted them—she, Dot Huntington!</p>

<p>The whole situation struck her as ridiculously
funny. She leaned against the kitchen table and
choked with silent laughter. This indeed was the
big, exciting adventure she had longed for all these
past years—infinitely big and exciting, pregnant
with thrilling possibilities.</p>

<p>Then she remembered her father saying that Billy
Gee had stolen twenty thousand dollars just the
night before. She grew anxiously grave. From
reflecting on the robbery she presently interpreted
the cause of her patient’s singular concern over the
safety of his saddlebags. They contained his stealings—currency,
most likely; twenty thousand dollars
in bills would make a bulky package, she believed.</p>

<p>Lemuel sauntered in from the barn some minutes
afterward. He prepared to wash.</p>

<p>“I don’t see his horse, Dot,” he began abruptly,
as he poured a dipperful of water into the basin.</p>

<p>“I turned it out with the rest—after I fed it.
The poor thing was——”</p>

<p>“You give him Baldy, I s’pose?”</p>

<p>“No. Sheriff Warburton appeared to get the
notion from what I said that I traded horses, and
I didn’t tell him different. I didn’t see why I
should,” she explained frankly.</p>

<p>Lemuel, in the act of rolling up his sleeves,
glanced around at her. He frowned.</p>

<p>“Are you meanin’ to tell me, Dot, that a dyin’
man with a sheriff at his heels’d resk a get-away on
foot—pertickler, a hard case like this here Billy
Gee? D’you think I’m a fool, Dot?”</p>

<p>“Well, count your stock if you don’t believe me,
daddy. You’re—you’re doubting everything I say,
to-day. I don’t know why. You’ve never done
that before.”</p>

<p>She spoke in such a meek, sorrowful voice that
it moved him to cross the room to her side and
kiss her tenderly on the cheek.</p>

<p>“Lord bless you, hon!” he murmured in loving
tones. “I ain’t aimin’ to doubt my leetle gal never.
You know that.” He laughed. “The on’y thing I
got to say is, it’ll be good-by, Billy Gee, ’fore the
week’s up, if he don’t git somepn faster’n two laigs
under him. He must ’a’ left his saddle an’ everythin’,
eh?” he added craftily.</p>

<p>“Everything,” nodded Dot, in a very decisive
manner.</p>

<p>Lemuel went back to the basin and silently proceeded
with his washing, but he said to himself:
“No bandit livin’ would do sech a crazy thing—shot
up, into the bargain. You might fool Bob
Warburton, daughter, but you can’t fool yore ol’
man. There’s ten thousand dollars hidin’ on this
ranch this minute.”</p>

<p>After supper, Lemuel composed himself in his
favorite chair and smoked his pipe and mused as
usual. It was a quiet night—exceptionally quiet,
thought Dot, who, mindful that only a thin board
partition separated her room from the kitchen, grew
more and more fearful as the evening dragged on,
in the knowledge that an accidental sound or movement
by her outlaw patient would lead her father
to investigate. She trembled at the consequences
to herself. By the hour she kept busy with the
noisy task of scouring pots and pans, giving the
cupboard a thorough overhauling, burnishing the
stove, making all the distracting sounds possible,
and wishing and wishing that Lemuel might go to
bed. But he had no such inclination.</p>

<p>“At three dollars a day, a man’d work over twenty
years for twenty thousand dollars, Dot,” he observed
pointedly, breaking a long silence. “An’
this Billy Gee gits it overnight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, daddy. But he doesn’t enjoy it. How can
he?” she replied, vigorously rubbing at the stove
lids. “Think of him being hunted from place to
place like a wild animal, the target for any man’s
gun, without home or any one to care for him
when he’s sick. Think of such a terrible existence!”</p>

<p>“When a feller tries an’ tries till the heart’s
kicked outer him, ’tain’t hard to tempt him. That’s
how I feel about it.” There was an ugly, suggestive
note in his voice.</p>

<p>She paused in her scrubbing and gave him a
quick, searching look. Some grim expression she
saw in his face, a dangerous flicker in his eyes,
filled her with sudden misgivings.</p>

<p>“I mean that!” he said harshly, with a vicious
jerk of his head. He had taken the pipe from his
mouth; his gaze was fastened on her accusingly.
“Look at me! I bin kicked an’ kicked! Year in
an’ year out I bin a-goin’ it, till I’m bruck down—petered
out, an’ not a cussed thing to show for
it. An’ look at other men who ain’t half as deservin’!
What’ve I got, eh? What’ve you got?”
He stiffened in his chair, gulped out suddenly in
tones that reverberated through the silent little
house: “An’ I’ve tried—God Almighty knows! An’
yore poor ma she—she died a-tryin’ an’ skimpin’
an’ dreamin’——”</p>

<p>“Father!” cried Dot aghast. Her face was white,
drawn; her eyes wide with alarm.</p>

<p>Sitting there in the yellow lamplight, Lemuel
Huntington was wild to behold; his features distorted
into hideous lines; his hands clenched, his
whole body trembling spasmodically. He burst into
a horrible laugh.</p>

<p>“To-day, you doctor up a low-down murd’rous
skunk that’d cut our throats to-morrow for the fun
of it. An’ ten thousand dollars gits by us, eh?
D’you hear that! D’you hear that? Ten thousand
dollars for Billy Gee, dead or alive! D’you know
what that means to us? An’ d’you reckon I’m
goin’ to sit still an’ let you——”</p>

<p>“Blood money!” she broke in, gasping out the
words. “Daddy, would you want to buy your food
and drink—mine—our clothes, pleasures—would
you be so inhuman as to find happiness at the expense
of a miserable fellow creature?”</p>

<p>“It’s the law—like the ten-dollar bounty on the
hide of the kiyote. Money is money,” he slung in
savagely. “I want you to c’nsider me, yoreself,
our c’ndition. I bin wantin’ to give you an edjucation,
to carry out yore ma’s dyin’ wish. I want
you to be somebody. We bin livin’ like dogs too
long. I’m damn sick of it! Outside o’ Agatha
Liggs, look at how them town hussies treat you!
An’ them edjucated shysters who ain’t fit to grease
my boots—what do I git from them? We need
money. We got to git money—<i>now</i>. Right off, see?
An’ if you can’t help me git it honest, ’cordin’ to
law, I’ll start out to steal it! I’ll turn bandit, an’
it’ll be for you to hide me out an’ take care of
me! What d’you say to that, eh? What’re you
goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>He had risen to his feet as he spoke. He crossed
the kitchen to her side and stood now, glowering
down on her, cupidity, fury, desperation flaming
from his eyes. Terrified, she stared at him. She
knew at last the reason for the marked change in
him, what he intimated. There was no way for
her to dodge the issue.</p>

<p>“You think I know where Billy Gee is——” she
began with an effort.</p>

<p>“You got him hid out, an’ don’t lie to me!” he
roared. “He’s too sick to ride, an’ you’re nursin’
him some place on this ranch. You can’t make no
damn fool out of me, young lady. Where is he?
You’re goin’ to tell me, or by hell, I’ll——” He
raised his clenched fists menacingly above her head.</p>

<h2 title='IV—Lemuel Yields' id='chIV'>
  CHAPTER IV—LEMUEL YIELDS
</h2>

<p>Lemuel Huntington, as has been suggested,
was not a forceful character. Even in this desperate
moment when the strength of his life’s mania
was being directed to gain that which would make
the fulfillment of that mania possible, he lacked
the stubbornness of will, the blind conquering
egoism, to win his demands at all costs. He had
never had occasion to present such a furious front
to his daughter before. That he was doing it now,
exerted a disconcerting influence upon him, embarrassed
him, made him a little uncertain as to the
fairness of his methods.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he had never even so much
as suspected the existence of a broad strain of
high-spiritedness in Dot’s nature and that firmness
of purpose which he himself did not have. The
launching of his threat roused her like the sting
of a whip. Her terror vanished and left her cold.
She strode up close to him now and let her eyes
burn into his.</p>

<p>“Father! Another word from you, and I’ll leave
the house. And I’ll never come back!”</p>

<p>He did not answer. He looked at her in a queer,
dumb frenzy. Then slowly, amazement, incredulity,
indecision grew on his face. He had never seen
her so dreadfully calm, so white before. She had
never threatened such a fearful thing before! A
long minute dragged by.</p>

<p>From out in the darkness came the weird shriek
of a predacious nighthawk. Presently, he turned
away from her, walked back to his chair, and began
filling with clumsy, trembling fingers his forgotten
pipe. His mouth was distorted with what seemed to
be some forlorn grief; his breath broke from his
lungs in low distressful gasps.</p>

<p>It grew very quiet. The old clock on the shelf
ticked tiredly. Some time afterward he heard a
sob and, glancing around, saw Dot leaning against
the wall, her face buried in her hands. Thereupon
he put down his pipe and went over and took her
in his arms. Hungrily he held her to his breast,
and there was in his eyes the reflection of the fierce
struggle that was taking place in his soul.</p>

<p>“Your poor, lonesome leetle heart,” he said, in a
voice that shook with sobs. “I didn’t aim to act so
cussed, darlin’. God knows, I wouldn’t do nuthin’
to hurt you, Dot! You know yore dad’d do anythin’
to make you happy. Don’t you, honey? I’d go
through fire an’ brimstone, I’d die for your daughter,
Emily, like I always said,” he added, his face
turned to the rafters under the roof.</p>

<p>Some time afterward, as he lighted his candle
to go to his room and kissed her good night, he
reassured her gently. “I jest git so disapp’inted
with myse’f, dearie. Yore poor ma an’ me used to
plan so many big things for our leetle gal. I’ve
wanted to do so much for you an’ I ain’t done
nuthin’. Anyway, Dot, we’ll ferget all about this
here Billy Gee. It ain’t worth quarrelin’ over, it
ain’t worth it, hon.”</p>

<p>Dot lingered in the kitchen until she was sure
he had gone to bed. Then she began hurried preparations
to spirit her outlaw patient out of the
house. Filling a bottle with hot coffee, she threw
some bread and meat into a paper bag. After
this she tiptoed to her room, stealthily unlocked
the door, closed it behind her, and lit the candle
on the bureau.</p>

<p>One glance, and she saw that her bed was empty,
the window open. Billy Gee was gone; so were
his saddlebags!</p>

<p>For an instant she stood perplexed. But she
breathed easier, vastly relieved that he had thus
chosen to steal out of the house without her aid.
Stepping over to the window she flashed the candle
outside and listened into the quiet night. There
was no sign of him, no sound. He must have
found his way into the hayloft, she told herself,
recalling the fact that she had described the location
of his new hiding place to him that afternoon.
But from reflecting on his weak condition
she became more and more concerned about him,
resolving finally to investigate his whereabouts and
take him the food.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of four feet from the window
sill to the ground, and a far safer means of exit
from the house at this late hour, particularly
after her father’s furious outburst, so unexpected
and ominous. She put out the light and let herself
down noiselessly into the strip of garden outside,
and flitted off like a shadow for the barn. With
a subdued little cough to herald her coming to the
fugitive, she climbed the short flight of steps to
the loft and struck a match.</p>

<p>He was there, standing knee-deep in the loose
hay, spectral, sinister, a six-shooter glinting in his
hand. At sight of her, he lowered the weapon and
clutched a tie beam for support. Ere the match
went out, she reached his side.</p>

<p>“I was leary it’d go hard on you if he ketched
me in there, so I sneaked out,” he explained in
low tones. “I heerd it all an’ I’m sorry I got you
in so much trouble. I’m goin’ to resk it, to-night.”</p>

<p>“No, no! You mustn’t,” she whispered quickly.
“The plains are alive with posses. You’d never
escape.”</p>

<p>He chuckled softly. “Wunst I git a-goin’, I’ll
be orright. The moon’s comin’ up, an’ I got folks
livin’ handy.”</p>

<p>“Here’s something for you to eat. You must
be terribly hungry—weak.” She thrust the bottle
and the paper bag into his hand as she spoke.
“I’d counted on you staying till you were stronger—three
days, anyway. You’d be perfectly safe here.
I’d see that you were. Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yore dad’s too sespicious. He’ll start huntin’
me up; you see if he don’t.” He broke off, resuming:
“I—I won’t ever ferget what you’ve done
for me, Miss Huntington. An’ you wouldn’t give
me away, would you? An’ you’re desp’rate for
money. I ain’t ever had anybody give me such
a square deal—chuck over a fortune to help——”
His voice trailed off into silence.</p>

<p>“You poor, wounded wild animal!” said Dot
gently. “Even a coyote is better off than you.
Can’t you understand? Don’t you know any different?
Is it so much easier to be bad, so much
more pleasing to have a pack of legalized killers
always on your heels? Or don’t you care?” She
paused and added: “Do you really want to repay
me for everything I’ve done for you?”</p>

<p>Through a square hole under the eaves, the first
white beams of the moon were just struggling in.
She could see the man’s face indistinctly; the white
bandage around his head.</p>

<p>“I do. Say it! Anythin’ you want done, Miss
Huntington,” he nodded.</p>

<p>“Then, quit this miserable life. Be a man. Go
far away, where no one will ever recognize you,
and start fresh. Be honorable—somehow. You
can do it, if you want to. But will you? To pay
me back?” There was a strange, dramatic note
in her voice.</p>

<p>He caught her hand suddenly, fervently. “I’ll
do it, Miss Huntington. Listen! You turned down
ten thousand dollars; you stuck by me. I’m goin’
to show you what I kin do for you. Some of these
days you’re goin’ to hear from me.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” she breathed. “I’d be so proud
to know that I helped remake the wild animal,
Billy Gee, into a God-fearing human being.”</p>

<p>A short, heavy silence fell. From somewhere in
the ground floor of the barn, a board expanding
with the cool night air snapped sharply.</p>

<p>“I come up here to take a coupla these old
blankets, sence I can’t lug my saddle; it’s too
heavy,” he announced, after a little while. “Would
you mind fixin’ ’em for me?”</p>

<p>She found them half folded, made a neat roll
of them, and looped them for slinging over the
shoulders with strips she tore from her calico apron.
As she prepared to leave him, he spoke again.</p>

<p>“Miss Huntington, I’d sorter like you to know that
I ain’t near’s bad as they tell it around. I ain’t
never killed a man—wounded ’em, yes, an’ only
jest when I had to. An’ with all I’ve got away
with, I’m next thing to broke this minute. That’s
honest——”</p>

<p>“But you held up the paymaster’s car last night,
didn’t you?” she interrupted.</p>

<p>“Yes’m. But I didn’t hold onto the money, bein’
wounded, an’ Warburton——”</p>

<p>“What was in your saddlebags that you said you
couldn’t afford to lose?”</p>

<p>“My mother’s pitcher, some clothes, an’ a lot of
leetle doodads I’m keepin’. I always have ’em along
with me. But I want to tell you ag’in that I ain’t
fergettin’ yore kindness. You’re goin’ to hear from
me, Miss Huntington, some time. An’—an’ I hope
you’ll be proud, like you jest said.”</p>

<p>Dot crept down the steps shortly afterward, shut
the barn door behind her, and darted across the
moonlit yard. Climbing back into her room she
cautiously lowered the window. Then, with a sigh
of relief and satisfaction, she went to bed. For
the remainder of the night, she lay wide-eyed, snug
in the bewitching embraces of romance and imagination.</p>

<p>Following her departure, Billy Gee remained in
the hayloft for a long interval and leisurely ate the
food she had brought him. Periodically, he looked
at his watch by the aid of a moonbeam streaming
in through a crack in the boards. When one o’clock
came, he got carefully to his feet, took up the roll
of blankets, and started downstairs.</p>

<p>From far out on Soapweed Plains, rose the wail-bark
of a foraging coyote. There was no other
sound. That semiarid land lay mute and mysterious
and teaming with tragic potentialities.</p>

<p>“Creepy,” he muttered under his breath. “Reckon
I’m a leetle flighty—leaked too much blood.”</p>

<p>He reached the ground floor and noiselessly made
his way toward the rear door of the barn, heading
for the field and his horse. As he fumbled in the
dark for the hasp an invisible figure emerged from
under the steps back of him. He felt the sharp
dig of a six-shooter between his shoulders. A voice
hissed in his ear.</p>

<p>“Steady, pardner! Make a move, an’ I’ll kill
you!”</p>

<p>In a twinkling, he was stripped of his guns.
Then his captor—Lemuel Huntington—unhasped the
barn door and herded him outside and down a
narrow lane between two corrals, until they stood
in the open field.</p>

<p>“Turn yore face to the moon, an’ let’s git a
squint of you, Billy Gee,” said Lemuel. He studied
the outlaw a few seconds. “So my gal was passin’
up ten thousand dollars for the likes of you, eh?
Well, I won’t! Now, listen clost an’ don’t make
no mistake about what I tell you! Me an’ you’s
goin’ on into Geerusalem right off, see? Warburton
wants you dead or ’live, an’ it’s up to you how
you care to be deelivered to him. I don’t. Savvy!
Now, march acrosst to them hosses!”</p>

<h2 title='V—The Wherewithal' id='chV'>
  CHAPTER V—THE WHEREWITHAL
</h2>

<p>When Dot awoke next morning, after a fitful
few hours’ sleep, it was nine o’clock. She
sprang out of bed and hurried through her dressing,
certain that her father was considerately waiting
his breakfast rather than disturb her, late
though the hour was. But upon entering the
kitchen, she found that he had not yet been about.
This fact at first astonished, then filled her with
alarm. She ran to his door and rapped sharply,
calling him, and experienced a feeling of deep relief
when she heard him yawn out a reply.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as she walked back into the kitchen
and began scraping the ashes out of the grate, she
reflected on the usual circumstance of Lemuel oversleeping;
for not in many years—and then only on
the several rare occasions that they had been out
late together the night before, attending a party at
some neighboring ranch—had he failed to have the
fire in the stove going for her. Later on she told
herself that it was quite probable their quarrel had
disturbed him, that worry had kept him awake,
and out of this conviction was born an acute
feeling of remorse which determined her to make
no reference to the time of day or to anything that
might recall the unhappy scene of the night.</p>

<p>For that matter, he also was silent on the subject.
He came into the kitchen, stretching himself tremendously,
grinning, in the best spirits she had
seen him in for many months. She could not help
but notice a remarkable change in him, but attributed
it to his desire to have her forget their
recent differences. So she met him halfway in
the effort and laughed merrily when he jested
about the professional fraternity he hobnobbed with
in camp and at his sly insinuations that Agatha
Liggs would make an adorable stepmother for some
girl. As he picked up his hat to look after his
chores he caught her in his arms, told her how
fondly he loved her, and that her happiness meant
everything in the world to him.</p>

<p>But alone, back of the barn, his display of
buoyancy vanished. He gazed down the lane between
the two corrals and reënacted in his mind’s
eye his brave capture of the notorious train robber,
Billy Gee, and the way he had marched the outlaw
into Sheriff Warburton’s room in the hotel before
daybreak and turned his prisoner over to the astounded,
sleepy-eyed official. Again, he felt an
ecstatic thrill over the realization that he had the
certified check of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad
for ten thousand dollars in his pocket that
very moment!</p>

<p>Nor could he subdue the wild surge of elation
that swept through his breast at thought that his
Dot was to receive the long-cherished education,
that here at last, after long, trialsome years of
waiting, was the crystallization of his dead wife’s
precious dreams all but fulfilled. Why couldn’t
this sacred woman of his heart have lived to enjoy
this great moment of happiness with him, to know
that all her trying and skimping and dreaming had
not been done in vain? Yes, he decided, Dot would
be educated “to the queen’s taste;” nothing would
be spared, nothing would be left undone to make
her the wonderful lady of accomplishments Emily
had so desired.</p>

<p>But with all the deep sense of gratification that
his reavowal of intentions gave him and the delight
he got from planning the glorious future, he could
not put out of his mind Billy Gee’s last words to
him in Warburton’s room that morning—what Billy
Gee had said, the look in his eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Huntington, I’m goin’ to be free one of these
days. When I am, I’m huntin’ you up. An’ you’re
goin’ to pay, Huntington. Remember that! Damn
you, you’ll pay like you never paid in yore life!”</p>

<p>There had been something so frightful, so murderously
frightful, in the threat as it fell from the
outlaw’s tight-drawn lips. Try as he would, Lemuel
had not been able to forget the hatred in the man’s
fiery eyes, the icy cut in his voice. He was doomed
to be haunted by them, to have memory rehearse
them over and over to him.</p>

<p>True, Billy Gee was even now being taken out
of the country, southwest to the county seat, San
Buenaventura, heavily shackled, under the hawklike
eye of Bob Warburton; and countless things would
happen ere the train robber served out the long
prison sentence that confronted him. But the mere
fact that he <i>would</i> serve it out, that he would be
free some time, was an overshadowing menace that
laid a firm, clammy hand on Lemuel’s heart.</p>

<p>For many minutes he stood and stared across
the plains. Doubtless Billy Gee would hunt him
up and kill him, he told himself nervously. A
vicious bandit of Billy Gee’s ilk would stop at nothing
to get revenge. He shook his head, feeling
strangely insecure. After a little, he recalled Dot’s
interest in the fellow. One thing was certain; she
must not even so much as suspect what her father
had done. Not until the episode was old and forgotten
must she know what had happened to the
fugitive.</p>

<p>He knew it was not love for Billy Gee that had
prompted her to hide him, help him to escape. Dot
was sentimental, romantic; she was just sorry for
the scamp. Most women were that way. But after
their quarrel last night she must never surmise
how he had treacherously spied on her, seen her
go into the barn, and lain in wait to capture the
man she was trying to save.</p>

<p>So while Dot prepared their breakfast her father
made plans whereby she might not know for years
to come just what had befallen the magnificent
bandit who had ridden into her life out of the
magical violet and yellow scallop of hills. In
the first place, Lemuel was determined to hurry
her out of the locality that she might not hear
of the heroic leading rôle he had played; secondly,
he cast about for a logical explanation of how
he came to have sufficient money to afford a journey
such as he contemplated. He knew Dot was too
familiar with his affairs not to question his sudden
acquisition of any considerable amount of money.
He struck upon a happy solution.</p>

<p>During the meal he mentioned rather casually
that he was going to Geerusalem to see if he could
negotiate a loan from Bob Warburton, and he
backed up the propriety of his action by declaring
that he had once come to the sheriff’s assistance
when the latter was financially down and out.</p>

<p>Dot was interested. To her query as to how
much he intended borrowing, Lemuel grinned confidently:</p>

<p>“A coupla thousand dollars, anyway. An’ I’m
purty sure to git it, at that.”</p>

<p>She stared across the table at him, perplexed
for the moment. What in the world possessed her
father this morning? He was so changed, so
self-confident, so resolute—as if he were laboring
under some suppressed emotion, some unusual good
tidings that he was with difficulty keeping to himself.
The strange way in which she studied him
made him hasten to put at rest any suspicion she
may have entertained.</p>

<p>“I bin thinkin’ it all over, Dot, an’ I decided that
what me an’ you needs most is a leetle more
pleasure an’ not so much stickin’ to a cussed ol’
ranch year in an’ year out like we bin doin’. So
I’m goin’ to borry some real money off Bob, an’
we’re takin’ a trip—Frisco, Noo York, or any place
you say. Le’s be good an’ happy wunst anyway,
an’ see how it feels. What d’you say?”</p>

<p>She brightened instantly. Her eyes widened,
sparkled with expectation. “It’d be just wonderful,
daddy,” she cried. “But—but you’d have to pay
the money back some time, and it would be so
hard——”</p>

<p>“We ain’t goin’ to stop to think o’ that, hon.
We’re out for one grand cut-up, me an’ you. Leave
it to me. I’ll do the worryin’. If I git it you’ll
go, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Go?” she echoed joyously. “Oh, daddy! I’ve
been wishing and wishing and wishing, months and
months and years, to see cities and orchards and
rivers and steamers and street cars and the ocean,
and——”</p>

<p>They talked on, Lemuel controlling by a desperate
effort the wild enthusiasm that consumed him, Dot
giving her eagerness unbridled play, planning and
scheduling an itinerary with a dispatch and thoroughness
that made him fairly marvel at her
cleverness. Shortly afterward, however, as he
was galloping toward camp he laughed aloud to
the boundless desolation of plain over the shrewd
way in which he had deceived his daughter, clever
though she was.</p>

<p>Dot stood on the front porch looking after him.
She watched him out of sight, her brain in a
delicious stupor at the glorious prospect of seeing
for the first time in her life the great fairyland
far to the north, that wonderful region she had
read and dreamed so much about. For a long
interval she reveled in the thought, until her eyes
turned to the violet and yellow scallop of range
in the distance. Her mind swung back to the present,
then to Billy Gee. How was he faring?</p>

<p>The day was hot, similar to yesterday. It was
very silent, too. Presently it began dawning on
her that to-day was different from any she had
ever known. She glanced over the garden. It
seemed lonesome; she had never thought it lonesome
before. The feel of the ranch, too, filled her with
an odd depression. Everything looked so colorless,
so uninteresting, so awfully the same. Her eyes
went back to the violet and yellow scallop of hills
again. That bleak playground of mirages where
she had visualized the figments of her imagination,
appeared to have lost its magic. The whole range
seemed faded, so wrinkled, so woefully unattractive,
like the bleached outlines of some shabby old crayon.
She turned into the house and entered the parlor.</p>

<p>For many seconds she stood and gazed down at
the lounge and began reviewing, as she had done a
number of times, her meeting with the notorious
Billy Gee, from the moment of his coming, until
she bade him good-by in the half light of the
hayloft.</p>

<p>“He isn’t the terrible person they say,” she told
the parlor lounge. “There are a lot of worse
men in Geerusalem who wear white collars and
polish their shoes every morning. They know how
to rob according to law. They haven’t the courage
to take to the open with a six-shooter. Poor fellow!
He was so grateful, and his voice was so lonely,
so gentle.”</p>

<p>She walked into her bedroom, still thinking of
him, and it came to her suddenly that she had
hidden the worst criminal of the generation in that
bedroom, that he had occupied her bed even! She
halted in the middle of the floor and blushed
furiously over the reflection. What would her
father say if he knew? And her dear old lady
friend, the good Mrs. Agatha Liggs? Or Sheriff
Warburton? The utter recklessness of her act now
struck her with full force.</p>

<p>But the next instant she was defending herself
with the argument that Billy Gee was bent on
mending his ways. He had promised her he would
reform. She believed him. If he were captured——</p>

<p>For some reason she felt no anxiety on that
score. He had been too confident of his ability
to evade the posses, had shown no alarm over the
information that they were out in numbers; besides,
he had mentioned having relatives living close at
hand, denoting that he would find safety with them
until such time as he could leave the country.</p>

<p>“You’re goin’ to hear from me, Miss Huntington,
some time,” he had said.</p>

<p>She experienced a strange little thrill when she
recalled that he was giving up his vicious career
solely because she had asked him to. It was such
a satisfying thought, such a proud conceit, to feel
that she, Dot Huntington, had exerted an influence
over this elusive terror of the Southwest who
laughed at the law and recognized nothing binding
upon him save the fulfillment of his own personal
desires. Yet, she told herself, she would look forward
from now on, hopefully, with keen anticipation,
to the day when she would hear from him.</p>

<p>While thinking thus, she had been standing near
her bed, gazing abstractedly at the old-fashioned
bureau opposite. Now her eyes became attracted
to a narrow edge of green showing just over the
top of the middle drawer. Thoughtfully, she
reached down and plucked at it with thumb and
forefinger. She drew it out—a ten-dollar greenback.
For one long instant she stared dumfounded
at it. Then she pulled out the drawer and fell
back with a low cry, gazing at the interior in
wide-eyed, fearful amazement. The drawer was
piled high with a disordered mass of currency of
all denominations.</p>

  CHAPTER VI—AFTERMATH
</h2>

<p>Geerusalem was a camp of many people of
many waspish dispositions. The engrossing
business of making money and spending it kept
this isolated desert settlement steering a more or
less wabbly, law-abiding course, for, like frontier
camps the world over, it had its furious six-shooter
forays, stealthy knifings, mob uprisings, its denizens
of dive and den. These things were simply because
civic unity was an unknown quality at the time,
the population of the fly-by-night variety, and the
county officials too busy serving the communities
where the majority vote held forth to concern
themselves with the “scattering returns.”</p>

<p>Established before the “blue-sky” law was written
into the statute books of California, this metropolis
of Soapweed Plains was the Mecca of the “wildcatter”—that
thrifty, gentlemanly rascal who tempts
gullible men and women of other climes to invest
their nest eggs in mining stock fit only to start
the kitchen fire. These gentry were the leading
citizens of Geerusalem, though their neighbors knew
them for what they were; autocratic, pompous
fellows, skimming just under the surface of the
law, clever swindlers who paid homage to none
save the mining engineer and the occasional moody
geologist who dropped unannounced into camp. A
mineralogist’s O. K. was a valuable thing to have
on a stock prospectus.</p>

<p>The .45-caliber brains with which Lemuel Huntington
hobnobbed, belonged, for the most part, to
these wildcatters—promoters, they styled themselves.
He was their standing joke, their dub, the something
at which they could sling the garbage of
their talk. From which it may be surmised that
he did not rank very high in the estimation of this
fraternity. Yet, heretofore, he had felt oddly gratified
over the thought that he could associate with
them; they were “big guns,” financially powerful,
influential to a great degree, and they had seemed,
to his way of thinking, to be exemplars of education
and refinement.</p>

<p>This morning, however, as he rode into camp
from his ranch, on what he had led Dot to believe
was a borrowing expedition, his viewpoint had undergone
a change. He was a far different Lemuel
Huntington from the tolerant, good-natured dub of
yesterday. He had captured the terrible, much-feared
desperado, Billy Gee. He had won a comfortable
fortune by his bravery. His Dot was
going to receive that long-dreamed-of education.
His breast was filled with it; his head reeled with
his own importance.</p>

<p>Geerusalem was seething with excitement. The
main street was clogged with men, discussing Huntington,
Billy Gee, the holdup of the paymaster’s
car, the dramatic entry at daybreak of captor and
captive while shotgun posses scoured the country
over a fifty-mile radius. It was a monumental
“catch,” unprecedented in Southwestern history.</p>

<p>As Lemuel rode into view, some one recognized
him. News of his presence in camp spread like
wildfire. A crowd surged after him, gathering in
size. He had not expected an ovation of such an
enthusiastic nature, and it embarrassed him. He
wished now that he had come in by a back street.
His face flaming red, flustered, he looked about
over the heads of that stream of humanity that
soon packed the thoroughfare from sidewalk to
sidewalk, acclaimed him as he rode along.</p>

<p>He spied Mrs. Agatha Liggs. She was standing
in the doorway of her little dry-goods store watching
his approach. As he came opposite her he
smiled and raised his hat. Then he grew abashed.
She had not acknowledged the salutation. In the
belief that she had not seen the action he bowed
again.</p>

<p>She was looking straight at him, and he thought
that her thin, pathetic face was unusually pale and
drawn, that her fragile little body was more stooped,
that her lips were strangely pursed. She looked
at him fixedly with an expression in her old eyes
so icy, so accusing, as to make him feel foolish
and uncomfortable. That look of hers flattened out
his conceit as nothing else could have done. He
rode on up the street to the bank, dismounted, and
went inside, wondering just why Mrs. Liggs had
snubbed him.</p>

<p>The huge crowd that had followed him, collected
before the building, and watching him through the
doors and windows, saw him cash the Mohave &amp; Southwestern’s
ten-thousand-dollar certificate check.
As he came out the door, acquaintances began hailing
him lustily. He heard flattering comments of
his valor on every hand.</p>

<p>“Gritty chap. You wouldn’t think it to look at
him, would you?”</p>

<p>“Brought him in single-handed. Fine work,
pardner!”</p>

<p>“Done overnight what a hundred posses couldn’t
do in ten years.”</p>

<p>“Good boy, Lem! Oh, you Nick Carter!”</p>

<p>Crimson as a turkey gobbler, sweat streaming
down his face, he led his horse to a livery stable.
Then he strutted down the plank sidewalk, the
mob stringing out behind him. Presently he entered
an auto-stage office, talked to the ticket seller about
mileage and rates, and ended by paying down the
rental of a machine, to be ready in an hour. Ten
minutes later found him swaggering big-chested
into the U. &amp; I. saloon—hangout of the .45-caliber
brains of Geerusalem. He glanced boldly around
at the uppish fraternity, posed about, fastidious and
blasé, deigned them a nod and ordered a drink.
This was the red-letter hour in Lemuel Huntington’s
life.</p>

<p>He leaned luxuriously against the bar, peeled off
a bill from his great wad, and to those who came
up to congratulate him on his daring feat, remarked
with considerable loftiness: “Yes, I reckon it takes
somepin’ better’n edjucation to handle a man like
Billy Gee.”</p>

<p>Downing his drink, he was turning to make his
stately way out of the place, when he heard his
name called, and a familiar hand was laid on his
arm. He recognized a young mining engineer friend,
a recent arrival from San Francisco. With him
was a tall sharp-eyed man, twenty-seven or thereabouts,
pleasing of face, and with a grave courtesy
that instantly marked him in Lemuel’s mind as a
total stranger to desert life. He was dressed in a
whipcord suit that was partly concealed beneath
a voluminous dust coat. On his head was a golf
cap, a pair of goggles thrust up over the visor,
and he carried driving gauntlets in one hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Huntington, meet Mr. Sangerly,” said the
mining engineer. The two shook hands. “Mr.
Sangerly’s father is Western manager of the Mohave
Southwestern, and he wanted to thank you in person
for your splendid service to his company by your
capture of this desperado, Billy Gee.”</p>

<p>Lemuel rubbed his chin in awkward fashion.
“There wasn’t nuthin’ much to it, Mr. Sangerly,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>“Indeed there was,” declared the other. “Why,
this outlaw has robbed our trains eight times in
the last three years. Besides our losses, Wells
Fargo has suffered greatly. You’ve done us what
I candidly look upon as an immeasurable service,
and the general office is being thoroughly informed
on the matter.” He paused. “There was a side
issue relative to your capture that I wished to
take up privately with you, Mr. Huntington—if you
have time, and if Mr. Lennox,” glancing at his
friend, “will excuse us.”</p>

<p>Three minutes later, they were seated across from
each other in a booth at the rear of the saloon,
a table between them, the waiter departing with
their order.</p>

<p>“Now, to start at the beginning, Mr. Huntington,”
said Sangerly, coming directly to the point, “Billy
Gee robbed our paymaster’s car at a grading camp
a few miles east of the station of Mirage. This
you doubtless already know. Well, Sheriff Warburton,
who had been in close touch with our Los
Angeles office ever since he got on the bandit’s
trail a week ago, wired us the same night of the
robbery. From the tone of his message Billy Gee
was heading north and his capture would be affected
within ten hours. That was the gist of the thing.
Anyhow, I started by auto yesterday morning. As
it happened, you beat Warburton to the honors.
You brought Billy Gee in, but the twenty thousand
dollars he stole from our paymaster is missing.”</p>

<p>“I’d thought about that,” Lemuel replied. “On
our way into camp this mornin’, I asked him in
pertick’lar what’d become of it, an’ he said it was
in safe hands.”</p>

<p>Sangerly lit a cigarette. “That’s what he told
Warburton and that’s what’s keeping me here. I’m
going to find out, if possible, who has that money.
I intend to arrest the party as an accomplice and
try to get him—or her—a jail sentence. There’s
not the slightest doubt in my mind that this unknown
person has been harboring the outlaw in
the past and has profited at the expense of our
company. You heard, of course, that he is supposed
to have relatives somewhere on Soapweed Plains?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” said Lemuel. “That’s what
Bob Warburton was tellin’ me. He said the only
reason that folks got that idee, was because after
robbin’ a train, Billy Gee’d always head this way
an’ disappear. But look at how far it is to the
railroad! That’s all talk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so, Mr. Huntington! Don’t
forget that this is the nearest point of habitation.
Now, let me explain something to you.” Sangerly
took a pencil from his pocket and began mapping
off the table roughly. “According to the sheriff,
with whom I had a long talk before he left for
San Buenaventura this morning, he followed Billy
Gee’s trail over every foot of the way—fifty-odd
miles, and barren desert all of it. By barren, I
mean flat, sandy country, and lacking those landmarks
which would tempt any outlaw, hard-pressed,
to hide his plunder. Moreover and most important,
Billy Gee was wounded—shot by one of the paymaster’s
crew as he was riding away. My opinion
is, therefore, that he brought the money direct to
your ranch and——”</p>

<p>“I can’t see how you figger that out, Mr. Sangerly,”
broke in Lemuel hurriedly. “Ain’t you kinder
insinuatin’ a leetle that I’m in cahoots with a train
robber?” he added in measured tones.</p>

<p>Sangerly hastened to correct the impression. He
caught the other’s hand, shook it laughingly. “The
furthest thing from my mind, my friend,” he declared.
“Certainly, I couldn’t imagine an accomplice
doing what you did. It’s not reasonable. It would
be ridiculous. But just follow me and you’ll agree
with me that my theory is correct as to fact. Now,
this is the exact situation: Here we have Billy Gee
with Sheriff Warburton at his heels—not over two
hours behind, mind you! Billy Gee is wounded,
bleeding badly. He is traveling over a country as
flat as this table, where there is no chance of hiding
his booty with any assurance of ever being able to
find it again—lack of landmarks, you understand?
And all the time he is becoming weaker from loss
of blood. From what little I saw of him to-day
it is a question in my mind whether he would
have risked getting off his horse to cache his stealings
if he had had a chance, through fear of not
being able to mount again.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, it is certain he was far more concerned
over getting his wound attended to than he
was about the money. So he must have pressed
forward as rapidly as his horse could carry him,
particularly since Warburton said that he had
him in sight after daybreak and up to the time he
dropped off the mesa onto the plains. Now, Mr.
Huntington, the paymaster’s crew told the sheriff
that Billy Gee stuffed the twenty thousand dollars—currency,
all of it—into his saddlebags, and you
brought him in without his saddlebags, I believe.”</p>

<p>“That’s c’rrect,” agreed Lemuel, with a troubled
frown. “I found he’d crawled in my barn. Afterward,
I located his hoss in the far end of the
field. But, it seems to me——”</p>

<p>“I questioned the sheriff carefully on that point,
but he said that all he knew was just what you
told him,” interrupted Sangerly. “His theory was
that the fellow turned his horse into your field
when no one was watching and took the opportunity
also of hiding his saddle and saddlebags, later on
finding his way into the barn to wait until night
when he might reach the home of his friend or
relative unobserved. That’s what I believe, Mr.
Huntington. I am quite convinced that Billy Gee
cached that money on your ranch. He could lie
low at this rendezvous of his, and some dark night
when the whole affair had blown over, he’d simply
slip out there and dig up the treasure. A very
natural step to take, in my opinion.”</p>

<p>Lemuel nodded slowly. “It sounds reas’nable, at
that. An’ you aim to look over the ground, I
reckon, to see if you kin locate the cache.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. Warburton has promised me he’ll
try to sweat the bandit into confessing. Meanwhile,
I’ll work on this end with two railroad detectives
whom I’ve brought with me. You’ll have no objections,
of course, if we spend a few days snooping
around the place, Mr. Huntington?” he asked smilingly.</p>

<p>“Not at all. Me an’ my daughter’s leavin’ for a
two-week trip to-day, but I’ll stick the key under
the front doormat, an’ you kin make yoreself to
home.”</p>

<p>Sangerly thanked him. They left the booth and
walked out to the street together. As they parted,
Lemuel said:</p>

<p>“When do you figger you’ll be out to the ranch,
Mr. Sangerly?”</p>

<p>“This afternoon, some time. Be assured we’ll
not abuse your hospitality, and I hope to see you
again on your return. By the way,” he added, as
an afterthought, “I understand you have a daughter.
Did she see Billy Gee, or have any idea of his
presence before his capture? I mean, had she
noticed anything that would have led her to suspect
the presence of a stranger in the neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Lemuel, with a positive shake of
his head. “She was surprised when I told her.
I had to show her the check I got, ’fore she would
believe me. I think you got it sized up about right;
this Billy Gee party jest watched his chanct, reckonin’
on a clean get-away. He turned his hoss out
along with mine to throw off sespicion, an’ buried
his swag where he could come an’ git it unbeknown
to anybody.” He laughed. “You don’t know my
Dot, Mr. Sangerly. If ever there was a real honest-to-goodness
little lady, she’s it—even if I do have
to say it. I want you to meet her when we git
back.”</p>

<h2 title='VII—Startling Predicaments' id='chVII'>
  CHAPTER VII—STARTLING PREDICAMENTS
</h2>

<p>That talk with the son of the Western manager
of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad did
not set well on Lemuel’s mind. Even the fact that
the Geerusalem <i>Searchlight’s</i> bulletin board, with
chalky eloquence, fairly bristling with superlatives,
made bold to proclaim him “California’s Bat Masterson,”
carried little if any thrill for him. Sangerly’s
words sounded like trouble in disguise. Sangerly’s
keen deduction of what had happened to the paymaster’s
money seemed alarmingly correct. It
seemed more, for on the heels of its apparent certitude,
came the distressing suspicion that Dot, having
assisted Billy Gee during his whole period at the
ranch, must know something about the disappearance
of his saddlebags. Sangerly was right. No
man in the bandit’s condition would have lost
precious moments trying to hide his stealings, particularly
in a trackless, changeable sand waste such
as lay to the south. It would have been the height
of folly, a useless piece of work, for he never
could have found his cache again. There was not
the slightest doubt but that that twenty thousand
dollars was on the Huntington Ranch.</p>

<p>So thought Lemuel, and then he recalled that
Sangerly had mentioned the presence of two railroad
detectives who were to aid him in the search.
What if they should dig up evidence involving
Dot? Sheriff Warburton had not so much as hinted
about her having harbored the bandit, from what
Sangerly had said; yet Warburton must surely have
suspected it. Bob Warburton certainly was a good
friend.</p>

<p>The longer Lemuel reviewed the situation, the
more he became convinced that he must get Dot
out of the country before these detectives began
their investigations. He shuddered at the fearful
disgrace were her name mentioned, even in the remotest
way, with the whole ugly affair. He would
pack her out of Soapweed Plains immediately.
Later on he would question her. He was fully
convinced that she would give him all the details
on the subject without hesitation when he asked
her.</p>

<p>He had still a few minutes left before the time
he must report back to the stage office. These he
devoted to hiring a man who would look after the
ranch during their absence. Afterward, he sought
the quiet and seclusion of a back street and wandered
aimlessly about, his mind busy with this
new disturbing angle that threatened to sully the
clean name of Huntington. So preoccupied was he,
that he entirely overlooked his intention of paying
Mrs. Liggs a visit to inquire the reason for her
cold treatment of him shortly before.</p>

<p>He found the rented machine ready and waiting
for him. Clambering in beside the driver, he was
soon whirling out of camp toward home. A strange
sense of security came to him. Sangerly and his
sleuths were left behind, and it would be only a
matter of a few short hours ere he and Dot would
be lost in the confusion and bustle of traveling
thousands. The proverbial needle in the haystack
would be as easy to find as they, he told himself.</p>

<p>When within a mile of the ranch he chanced to
glance in the direction of the low line of chromatic
hills across which his acreage extended. A man
was trudging along through the greasewood brush,
steering diagonally for the road. He was less than
a quarter of a mile off, and Lemuel squinted at
him curiously.</p>

<p>“Who’s that sun lizard? Kin you make him
out?” he asked the driver.</p>

<p>The latter looked. “Sure. That’s old Tinnemaha
Pete, a prospector. You must know him. Hangs
around Mrs. Liggs’ store a lot. She’s bin grubstaking
him for years, I hear. Some one was
telling me he used to be her husband’s partner.”</p>

<p>Lemuel nodded. “Come to think of it now, I did
meet him there wunst.”</p>

<p>“Poor old devil! If it weren’t for her he’d have
starved to death long ago,” said the driver. “The
gold fever sure gets ’em, don’t it? He’s been going
it all his life and never found anything. Never
will, I reckon. One of these days, he’ll go out
and the old desert’ll pick his bones clean. That’s
how most of these granddads end up.”</p>

<p>The machine sped on, its dust cloud trailing across
the flat, enveloping the bent, shriveled form of Tinnemaha
Pete, rocking pathetically along on his unsteady
legs, a canvas bag slung over his shoulder,
bound for Geerusalem. Like some misshapen
wraith, born of the grotesqueness and deformity of
that wild, mystic desolation, he fled on, his long
gray beard whisking about in the hot breeze, his
baggy clothes bulging and shrinking in the wrench
and flip of its frolicking.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the automobile stopped before
the Huntington gate, and Lemuel sprang out and
hurried up the walk toward the house. Dot, attracted
by the approach of the car, had come to
the front door. She greeted her father with an
expression of blank amazement.</p>

<p>“What in the world, daddy——” she began.</p>

<p>“Git ready to travel, hon!” he cried out excitedly,
as he put an arm around her and drew her into
the house. “Looket! Looket! We got money. What
d’you think o’ that?” He fished out a handful of
bills and waved them before her face. He broke
into a gleeful laugh, so well assumed that it deceived
her. “What’d I tell you, eh? Bob Warburton
come through like a leetle major. Loaned me two
thousand dollars on my note. Think o’ that! Ain’t
that jest dandy? Come on, now! Chuck some duds
in a valise. We’re startin’ right out on a big
blow-out. We’re goin’ to see the world—me an’
you.” He romped around the room with her, like
an overjoyed schoolboy.</p>

<p>“But, daddy,” she protested in bewilderment, “how
can I? Why, you don’t give me time to——”</p>

<p>“You don’t need nothin’. I’m goin’ to tog you
out complete with a hull bran’-new outfit, soon’s
we hit the city. Hurry up! We ain’t got all day
to talk about it, Dot. We’re strikin’ south to Mirage.
I’m on’y takin’ a shirt an’ a pair o’ socks, myself.”
He headed for his room.</p>

<p>“But who’s to look out after the place, the
chickens and stock and——”</p>

<p>“I got it all fixed for a man to come this afternoon—Billy
Higgins,” he called out. “He’ll ride
over from camp every day an’ look around. Come
on, hon! Do’s I say, can’t you? That driver is
chargin’ fifteen dollars an hour.”</p>

<p>Dot capitulated. She hurried into her room and
closed the door after her. Hesitating an instant,
she locked it cautiously; then she dragged a suit
case out of the closet and spread it open on the
bed. For some seconds, she stood motionless, undecided,
in troubled thought. In the middle drawer
of her bureau lay a fortune in stolen money. During
her father’s absence in camp she had carefully
counted it over to satisfy her suspicions that it was
stolen money, and she had found that it reckoned
up to the amount Lemuel had told her was stolen
by Billy Gee from the paymaster’s car of the
Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad Company—twenty
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>What must she do with it? Here she was the
custodian of a great sum, ill gotten, placed in her
hands without her knowledge or consent, without a
word or hint as to what was expected of her. She
had been made an innocent accomplice. She knew
that, in the circumstances, were the house to be
searched for this missing booty of Billy Gee, she
would have a desperate time, if the officers should
discover that drawerful of bills, to account for the
presence of an amount of money the same as that
lost by the railroad company.</p>

<p>Until her father had burst in upon her, urging
this uncalled-for hurried departure that for some
unexplained reason he had given her not the slightest
hint about, she had quite decided that the best
course for her to pursue was to go to Geerusalem
and turn the booty over to the constable or the
postmaster, stating simply that she had found it
and wished it returned to its rightful owners. This
she had determined to do in person; for if there
was one thing on which she had firmly settled her
mind, it was that Lemuel should be kept in ignorance
about the money. After his display of desperation
last night and the fearful threats he had
made, she shrank from telling him of her discovery,
lest in a moment of recklessness he might be tempted
to force her to surrender the treasure to him, and
appropriate it to his own uses. She had grown
sick at the terrifying thought.</p>

<p>Another thing—one that had impressed her more
deeply than she really knew at the time—was the
realization that Billy Gee had left her this fortune
out of appreciation for the little she had done for
him. The act bespoke the character of man he
was at the core—plunder though this fortune represented.
It was about as big a gift as he could
have made to her. He had risked his life to get
it—been shot and bled white in the bargain. While
she and her father had been quarreling over him
he had lain in the darkness of her room, listening.
He had learned that they were very poor, that the
dream of the Huntingtons had been to give their
daughter an education, that, notwithstanding their
financial straits, that daughter was not in favor of
surrendering him—outlaw, though he was—to gain
the comforts that ten thousand dollars’ reward would
bring. She also knew that later, in the hayloft,
he had purposely misled her as to the contents of
his saddlebags, in order to make his secret gift
certain of acceptance.</p>

<p>Just now she stood in her room and pondered over
what she should do with this unwelcome gift, since
her father’s impetuousness had upset her plans.
She reasoned that it would be nothing short of folly
to leave the money hidden until their return, thus
risking its loss by fire or theft. There seemed no
other way except to take it along with her. They
wouldn’t be gone but a few days, perhaps two
weeks at the longest. Once back home she could
carry out her original intention of putting it in the
hands of the Geerusalem authorities for transmission
to the general offices of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern
Railroad.</p>

<p>So thinking, she opened the bureau drawer and
hurriedly wrapped up the stacks of bills in her
mother’s old silk shawl, tied the bundle securely
with string, and packed it into the suit case along
with some articles of clothing. Then she began
dressing, in a growing fury of joyful anticipation
and excitement, for her long-wished-for trip to a
big city was at hand, her longing of years to be
gratified at last.</p>

<p>Half an hour after Lemuel arrived from camp
he was locking the front door of his home and
placing the key under the mat for Sangerly. He
walked slowly down the gravel path to the gate
and crossed the garden toward the trim little grave
under the drooping pepper tree. Wistfully he gazed
down at it, and the moisture crept into his eyes
when he saw Dot kneel and kiss the tips of her
fingers and press them gently on the mound.</p>

<p>“Little angel mother,” she breathed. “How I
wish you were going with us. How I wish you
were here, darling.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur, sitting in the machine outside the
gate, averted his head and looked away into the
gaunt desolation of the plain.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, father and daughter were comfortably
settled in the rear seat and, like two children
embarking on some glorious adventure, began
their journey down the hot sandy floor of Soapweed
Plains, bound for the dreary railroad station of
Mirage. They reached there around four o’clock,
ate dinner in the combination saloon-store-restaurant,
and boarded the northbound train at dark.</p>

<p>It so happened that, owing to the joyous anticipation
and breathless conjecture with which the trip
itself engrossed her, not until the conductor came
down the aisle to collect the tickets was Dot suddenly
reminded that she had not asked her father
how long he contemplated being gone. The uniformed
person had passed on when she broached
the subject.</p>

<p>“Are we going to be away very long, daddy?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“We sure are,” said Lemuel cheerfully. “We’re
out for a big time. What I mean—big. An’ we’re
goin’ to see everything worth seein’, you kin gamble
on that, Dot. If there’s anything your little heart
desires, jest say so.”</p>

<p>“But how long—about a week or so?” she persisted.
“There was something I wanted to attend
to when I get back.”</p>

<p>“Get back?” laughed Lemuel. “Now listen here,
hon! Furst, me an’ you’s goin’ to have the fling
of our young lives. Then——” He broke off and,
looking fixedly at her, grinned oddly. “You’ve seen
the last of Soapweed Plains, Dot, for anyway three
years. I’m toggin’ you up like a queen, an’ you’re
sailin’ into Longwell’s Seminary for to be edjucated.
That’s the main reason why I borried the money.”</p>

<p>Dot stared at him incredulously. Then, marking
the strange set to his jaws, the triumphant glint
in his habitually mild eyes, cold fear gripped her
heart suddenly.</p>

<p>“Three years!” she choked. “Daddy, you’ve—you’ve
deceived me. You’ve lied to me——”</p>

<p>“I’ve done it for your own good, Dot. ’Tain’t
wrong to lie when it’s to help some one you love.”
He paused. “You say you got somepn to ’tend to.
Is that why you want to git back home?” he asked,
his mind on the missing paymaster’s money.</p>

<p>“Not altogether. But—but it’s one of the reasons.”</p>

<p>“An’ it’s important, ain’t it, honey?” As he spoke
he bent his head and gazed up into her face, his
expression crafty, knowing.</p>

<p>“Not so important as caring for you, daddy,”
she returned brokenly. “Nothing in this world
matters so much as that.”</p>

<p>He did not press the subject. He sat back in
his seat and studied his horny hands wistfully.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, Dot began arguing against
this decision of his to send her to school. They
talked for two straight hours, she objecting on
every ground she could think of, he countering
stubbornly, now besting her, again being himself
bested. Spiritedly she protested. She was too old
to go to school; they needed the money for other
purposes; she wouldn’t leave him to live alone on
the ranch; she didn’t want an education. But all
her vehemence and tears and supplications were of
no avail. There was no shaking the determination
of Lemuel Huntington.</p>

<p>So, in sheer exhaustion, she finally gave up and,
lapsing into silence, devoted herself to the solution
of the momentous problem of what she should do
with the stolen treasure she was bringing along
with her, wrapped in her mother’s old silk shawl.</p>

<p>After long reflection she concluded she would turn
it over to the San Francisco authorities on her arrival,
reasoning that it really did not matter which
civil authorities received it, since it would be forwarded
to the railroad company anyway. Having
relieved her mind thus, her thoughts drifted to
Billy Gee, and she found herself wondering lingeringly
about him and if the wound in his head were
giving him much trouble, where he might be in
that great, lonely void of desert far to the south,
if he were thinking of her. Foolish, vagrant little
thoughts, they were; but somehow, they seemed to
her to be very serious indeed, and so pleasing
as to bring a warmth to her cheeks, and so tragic
as to cause the tears to form in her eyes.</p>

<p>Lemuel sat and also reflected, but his thoughts
were of another sort, a legion of sleep-dispelling
meditations that crowded his brain, clamoring for
review. He was so jubilant with himself and the
fulfillment of the big dream of his life. His mind
in a riot of joyous anticipation, he sat planning to
make his brief stay in San Francisco an epochal
event.</p>

<p>He threw back his head against the high back
of his plush seat and chuckled silently at the clever
manner in which he had enticed Dot into leaving
the ranch, how splendidly his lie about borrowing
two thousand dollars from Sheriff Warburton had
worked out, how successfully he had manipulated
affairs so that Dot would possibly never know that
her father had played the sneak to effect the capture
of Billy Gee. Yes, and there was also considerable
satisfaction for him in the knowledge that he, Lemuel,
had spirited his Dot out of the country before
Sangerly and his bloodhounds could even see her,
not to mention interview her.</p>

<p>He told himself that if for no other reason than
to insure her against annoyance he would likewise
keep her whereabouts secret. No one would
know that she was attending the Longwell Seminary
until the search for the missing twenty thousand
dollars had come to an end. Meanwhile, he would
contrive to question her and find out what she
knew about those saddlebags and their contents.
Dot would tell him, of that he felt quite sure; and
some day perhaps, when the whole thing was ancient
history, and she had graduated with high honors,
he would tell her how her father had captured,
single-handed, the far-famed daring desperado, Billy
Gee, and why he had done it.</p>

<p>Morning found him still wide-eyed, staring unseeingly
out of the car window at the multiplying
miles of rich San Joaquin Valley acreage flashing
by. Around seven o’clock the train stopped for a
few minutes at Tracy, a junction town, and passengers
from the north began piling in.</p>

<p>A newsboy came hurrying down the aisle, clamoring
his wares excitedly. Lemuel hailed the youngster
and bought a paper. Dot still slept and, seeing
this, he settled himself comfortably in the seat
to read. The following instant he caught his breath
in sudden alarm, and sat bolt upright. His face
paling through its tan, he glared with bulging eyes
at the three words printed in large display type
across the top of the first page.</p>

<blockquote style='margin-left:20%; width:60%;'>
    <div class='tac mb05'>DESPERATE BANDIT ESCAPES!</div>
    <p class='ni'>Billy Gee Attacks Sheriff, Plunges From Fast-moving
    Train Near Burbank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a long moment, Lemuel continued to glare
fearfully at those headlines, then he sank limply
back in his seat.</p>

<p>He felt Dot stir and, looking guiltily at her, saw
that she was waking. Whereupon, he stuffed the
paper into his pocket and presently rose and walked
unsteadily out of the coach, heading for the smoking
car. From that instant forward, he carried day
and night in his mind a picture of Billy Gee standing
in Sheriff Warburton’s room in Geerusalem
and he heard again the bandit’s ominous threat:</p>

<p>“Huntington, I’m goin’ to be free one of these
days. When I am, I’m huntin’ you up. An’
you’re goin’ to pay, Huntington. Remember that!
Damn you, you’ll pay like you never paid in yore
life!”</p>

<h2 title='VIII—Lavender and Old Lace' id='chVIII'>
  CHAPTER VIII—LAVENDER AND OLD LACE
</h2>

<p>Alexander Sangerly—“Lex” Sangerly, his
friends called him—was a democratic type of
Californian, who did not believe that the fact of
his father being Western manager of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern
Railroad system should of necessity
mean that that father’s son must take any exalted
credit unto himself. So, notwithstanding the fact
that Lex held the important post of division superintendent
of the road, he was not above meeting
the rank and file of his departments on their own
plane, mixing with them, addressing them by their
given names, and conducting himself generally in
business as well as social affairs very much like
any red-blooded human.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it might be well to mention that,
although only twenty-seven years old, he was already
blossoming out into a prominent railroad figure,
with the likelihood of making good future
presidential timber for some transcontinental road.</p>

<p>The gold camp of Geerusalem was Lex’s first acquaintance
with a desert bonanza settlement, that is,
one in the high noon of its prosperity, its mines
giving up great fortunes, its people drunk with
success scattering their wealth prodigally, its night
life unlicensed, violent with rashness and lust; yet
Geerusalem with all its lawlessness gripped him
with a compelling fascination, the fascination one
feels who looks for the first time on something
horribly real, incredible of human toleration, though
tolerated and upheld by a civilized population that
drops back to the primitive when the law is weak.</p>

<p>However, apart from his curiosity and interest
in this wild, waspish desert camp, Lex had by
chance discovered, on the very day of his arrival,
a far more important reason why he was glad he
had come to Geerusalem. As he was driving his
high-powered roadster up the main street his eye
alighted on a modest little signboard nailed above
a tiny store, crowded between two large adobe
buildings. It read: “Mrs. Agatha Liggs, Dry
Goods.”</p>

<p>He had read that modest little sign, with a thrill
of joy. There could be but one Agatha Liggs in
the whole wide world, he told himself, and that
was the dear little woman whom he had known
far back in his boyhood days—the mother of his
chum and pal, Jerome Liggs.</p>

<p>His earliest memory of Mrs. Liggs and her son
dated back to when he was five years old, living
in the archaic town of San José, with his parents,
during the dark period of his father’s striving to
rise out of the rut of clerkship. The two families
had been next-door neighbors for a number of
years, and he remembered Jerome’s father as a
big jovial man, who used to drive a truck by day
and play cards with the elder Sangerly by night.</p>

<p>Jerome and Lex attended the same school. Mrs.
Liggs’ son was a sturdy, fearless youngster, the
dunce of his class. Lex, on the other hand, was
timid and delicate, studious and a star scholar.
Singularly enough, they had formed a great friendship,
perhaps because of their very contrariness
of character one to the other and their natural
tendency to lean on each other, as it were. Lex
never really knew how many times doughty Jerome
had stepped in and thrashed a boy bully for him,
but he did know that these services more than
amply repaid him for the innumerable times that
he had helped his champion with problems in
arithmetic, grammar, spelling, and the rest of the
educational mysteries. Nor could he ever remember
the number of occasions he had shared Jerome’s
bed overnight; nor had he ever forgotten the countless
fat slices of Mrs. Liggs’ pumpkin pie he had
devoured.</p>

<p>Up to the age of twelve, this Damon-Pythias comradeship
had continued uninterruptedly. Then came
the day when Sangerly, senior, had invented a cold-storage
system that had promptly found marked
favor with the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad,
with the result that, besides purchasing his patents,
it employed him to oversee the installation of the
apparatus in its refrigerator cars.</p>

<p>In the years following the departure of the Sangerlys
from San José, the Liggs’ family had dropped
out of sight. Lex had once heard from a mutual
friend that Jerome’s father had been killed in an
accident, and that the widow had moved to the
southern part of the State. But though he had
never found out what had become of him, he always
retained a tender memory of his boy chum,
and there seemed nothing that could ever blot out
his respect for the lowly pumpkin pie. Now here
at last, he had suddenly discovered, in this uproarious
frontier settlement of Geerusalem, of all places,
the motherly little Mrs. Liggs.</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be wondered at then, that after
his talk with Lemuel Huntington in the U. &amp; I.
saloon, and before he began his search for the
vanished twenty thousand dollars, he must first pay
a visit to that diminutive dry-goods store on the
main street. At the very moment that Dot’s father
was speeding out of town in the automobile that
was to take him and his daughter on the first leg
of their journey to San Francisco, Lex brought his
roadster to a stop before Mrs. Liggs’ establishment.</p>

<p>He found to his surprise that the place was to
all appearances closed for the day, the blind drawn
down over the display window. Nevertheless, he
knocked sharply and peered into the dark interior
through the small glass panel in the upper half
of the door. Presently the door in the rear of the
store opened, and, after a short hesitation, the
proprietress herself came walking slowly forward,
wiping her eyes on her apron, arranging her white
hair and smoothing out her immaculate, stiffly-starched
dress. The next moment she was standing
in the doorway, looking inquiringly at him through
her spectacles.</p>

<p>“Mother Liggs! Bless your dear old heart!” he
cried out in a voice vibrant with feeling. “Don’t
you know me? Lex Sangerly!” He beamed on
her, while she, squinting up at him, searched his
face with infinite gravity, a trace of suspicion in
her look.</p>

<p>She was a tiny, tired-out mite of a woman,
around sixty-five, her hair like snowy silk, her
eyes a faded blue, large, and just now showing
indications of recent tears. Her dress, muslin and
rather old-fashionedly made, was the most correct
thing in feminine attire worn in the camp; at least,
so declared the godless population of Geerusalem.</p>

<p>She studied her visitor for a few seconds, then
her eyes lighted up like twin stars. “Lex—Lex
Sangerly! You dearest, dearest boy. Of all things—Lex
Sangerly! Oh, I’m so—so glad to see you,
Lex. So awful glad to see you——” She choked
suddenly.</p>

<p>Clutching his hand, she led him inside, locked
the door and, chattering her joy, escorted him to
the little living room back of the store. She insisted
on his occupying her best chair, fixed a
footstool for him under his feet, and sat close beside
him, feasting her gaze on him, listening hungrily
while he talked. And this he did, regaling
her with a summary of what he and his family
had been doing since she last saw them. It was
a dazzling recital of achievement, with happiness
and success through every portion of it, one of
those inspiring narratives that makes one’s failures
seem more prodigious than they really are.</p>

<p>“And now,” he concluded, “the old man has ordered
me to camp out here on this desert until I
find out what Billy Gee—the notorious outlaw who
was captured last night—did with the twenty thousand
dollars he stole from our company. I guess
you’ve heard all about it.”</p>

<p>She had taken up her knitting while he talked,
her fingers manipulating the needles mechanically,
though her eyes never left his face. She stopped
now to disentangle a snarl and bent her head over
it, plucking nervously at the yarn.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard,” she said, at last. “Have you
any idea, Lex——”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest. I’m making a search of Mr.
Huntington’s ranch. That’s where he was caught,
you know. By the way, you must know Huntington—a
rancher, south of here?”</p>

<p>She nodded as she resumed her knitting. “He
made ten thousand dollars mighty easy. The easiest
money Lem Huntington ever made—bringing in a
dying man.” There was a strain of bitterness in
her tones.</p>

<p>“He has rendered the community a great service,
Mother Liggs; we can’t overlook that fact,” said
Lex. “This wretched scoundrel, Billy Gee, has held
up M. &amp; S. trains for the past three years, robbed
passengers, and laughed at every posse that ever
took up his trail. He’s always been invincible, I
hear, managing to slip his pursuers whenever he
wanted to. He’s been a menace.”</p>

<p>“That might all be, Lex, but there’s some good
in the worst of us. You’ll admit that, won’t you?”</p>

<p>He smiled. “You’re not very familiar with this
crook’s exploits, I can see that, Mother Liggs. Why,
trainmen who have brushed up against him say
he’d as soon kill a man as look at him.”</p>

<p>An audible gasp broke from her. Her thin face
paled and set ever so little, while into her faded
eyes rose a flickering fire.</p>

<p>“It ain’t true. It’s—it’s sinful for any one to
say such a thing. Lex, I want to tell you something
about Billy Gee that you can believe, because
I never lie, and that is—he’s given away
every cent he ever stole. Don’t ask me how I
know. Ask any man on the street, and he’ll tell
you that there’ll be more broken hearts and empty
cupboards now that Billy Gee is—is gone, than if
the Geerusalem mines shut down to-morrow.” She
paused, then added: “I know it don’t sound just
right, Lex, but I wish—I wish he’d never been
caught.”</p>

<p>Sangerly regarded her curiously for a moment.
Some appealing, subtle sadness he saw in her
face caused him to burst out with a merry laugh
and lean over and take her in his arms.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t try to disillusion you for the world,
you darling,” he cried, as he kissed her. “You
nor any other woman could condemn a man of
Billy Gee’s type. You all feel for the wayward
man. You pity him. You want to help him, for
that is the blessed mission of this wonderful mother
love of yours.” He digressed, with a broad smile:
“Before I forget, I want to take you out for some
real joy rides in a new roadster I have; which
means, of course, that you must introduce me
around among the first families of Geerusalem. I
want to be initiated into the mysteries of bacon
and beans and sour dough bread.”</p>

<p>She returned his smile and looked at him, admiration
in her eyes. “Did you meet Dot—Lem
Huntington’s daughter?” she asked presently.</p>

<p>“No. She’s one of the belles of the camp, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Dot Huntington is one of the finest girls in
the West, Lex.”</p>

<p>“Whew! You’re some little booster. Pretty?”</p>

<p>“Pretty as a picture, and sensible. That’s a combination
you don’t often find, Lex, and you know
it. She’s a girl any man would kneel to,” she said
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Mother Liggs, you interest me. You must tell
me more about this charming young lady. I want
to meet her. You see, I’ve always believed my
San Francisco girl was the prize winner, but it
just may be that this fair daughter of Geerusalem
is—well, I’ll tell you after I see her.” He paused,
then resumed seriously: “Right now, I want to
hear about your own affairs. How have you been
getting along all these years? And you haven’t
even mentioned Jerome. Where is he?”</p>

<p>It was very quiet in Mrs. Liggs’ living quarters,
quite like a sanctuary; the three rooms flanked
on either side by drab adobe walls and overlooking
a back yard of some size, cut up into little
plots—the only flower garden in Geerusalem, with
a patch of vegetables growing in one corner. A
gate opened into a narrow alleyway that led to the
rear street.</p>

<p>“Jerome?” echoed Mrs. Liggs, after a short silence.
She was gazing intently at her knitting.
“Jerome is dead, Lex.” She spoke slowly, haltingly.</p>

<p>“Dead!”</p>

<p>He looked hard at the snowy bowed head a moment.
Then he drew her gently to him again and
laid his cheek against hers.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry to hear that,” he said in a voice
that was tenderly sympathetic. “How long ago——”</p>

<p>“Lex, deary!” she broke in sobbingly. “Don’t
let’s talk about it—please! The wound is too fresh,
the pain in my heart is too—I can’t explain. Some
of these days maybe, I’ll tell you the story. There
ain’t many that would understand—that would believe.
I know you could, ’cos—’cos you and Jerome
were such good friends. When I saw you, you
looking so—so happy and prosperous, I just—I
just couldn’t help thinking that my boy——” She
couldn’t finish. Burying her face in her apron, she
wept disconsolately as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>Some time afterward, she told him about herself
from the day fifteen years ago, that the Sangerlys
moved from San José, and he remarked that it was
much the same tale of striving that any of thousands
of American mothers might relate—the indomitable,
ceaseless struggle to get ahead.</p>

<p>“Then, after Mr. Liggs’ death, we drifted north
to Marysville,” she concluded wearily. “I went into
the delicatessen business and did well. One day,
Jerome—it was a hard battle alone, Lex, but I
managed to save money, and afterward I came to
Geerusalem and opened this store. I’m the only
woman in business here, and every one patronizes
me. The boys won’t allow anybody to run opposition
to me,” she added, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>Two hours passed quickly, considering that Mrs.
Liggs insisted that Lex have lunch with her, disregarding
his attempts to explain that he had an
appointment with his two detectives at one o’clock.</p>

<p>So it was early afternoon when he finally picked
up his hat and prepared to leave. At that juncture,
a sharp knock sounded on the kitchen door, and
the following moment, Mrs. Liggs was ushering
forward an outlandish, shriveled-up, old fellow of
seventy, who halted suddenly in the center of the
room and fastened a pair of watery blue eyes
suspiciously on Lex.</p>

<p>“This is Tinnemaha Pete, Lex,” said Mrs. Liggs.
“He’s my prospector, and some day we’re going to
strike it rich. Ain’t we, Pete? This is Mr. Sangerly.
I knew him when he wore long curls, Pete,
and he used to cuddle up in my lap and go to
sleep. Didn’t you, Lex?”</p>

<p>“I see that ornery skunk, Lem Huntington,
sashayin’ round in a ottermobile—too cussed lazy
to drive hisself,” cackled the funny, little old man.
“Hell burn his rotten hide! I’d like to——&#160;Hoo,
hoo! I’ll fix the stink-cat. See ef I don’t! What’s
yore business, Mr. Spangaree? You’re sorter high-toned,
ain’t you? City duck, what?” He tossed
a bulging canvas sack he carried on his shoulder
into a corner of the room. “There’s some rock,
Agatha—tol’rable good, tol’rable good.”</p>

<p>Tinnemaha Pete was a horrible example of what
the Southwestern desert does to men who sneer at
its death-dealing forces and flirt with its snares
too long. His body was warped, twisted, broken,
his skin dry and tough as weathered leather, his
eyes rheumy, burned out by sun glare. A pathetically
few thin long hairs of beard still remained
to him, and a scanty rim of gray circling the back
of his bony, bald head, were the only evidences
of a once shaggy brown thatch with which nature
had endowed him.</p>

<p>Tinnemaha Pete, however, knew the Mohave
Desert from center to circumference better than
any man of those times, it was freely conceded.
Whatever that gaunt, fiery, dead land had done to
him, however hard it had striven to lay him a
paralyzed heap to roast alive on its molten bosom,
it had not killed the questing spirit of the prospector
in him. Winter and summer, for a quarter of a
century and more, he had searched and searched
and searched that vast solitude for the undiscovered
treasures which his experience told him must be
somewhere embedded in those countless, chromatic
ranges that crisscrossed that untrodden principality.</p>

<p>Through his years of wandering he had come to
know the face of the Mohave as intimately as he
knew the vile, black, short-stemmed pipe he smoked.
What was equally, if not more, important, he had
taught Billy Gee what he knew of that desert,
thereby making the bandit invincible when fleeing
over this no man’s land, with posses yelping at
his heels.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the arrival of Tinnemaha
Pete, Lex took his departure. Mrs. Liggs saw him
to the street door and stood watching him wistfully
as he drove away up the street. Then she shuffled
tiredly back to the living room, dropped into a
chair, and buried her face in her hands. Tinnemaha
Pete peered hard at her, his lips moving,
guttural sounds issuing from his throat.</p>

<p>“What ails ye?” he cried out. “What ails ye,
Agatha?”</p>

<p>And because he surmised and was powerless to
help her, he started a wild falsettoed string of
abuse leveled at Lemuel Huntington, Sheriff Warburton,
and that destiny to whose exactions all
men must yield themselves.</p>

<p>“Jerome, son!” sobbed Mrs. Liggs forlornly.
“Why couldn’t you have been like him? Dear God,
what have I done that I should suffer like this?
My burden is so heavy. Lord, so awful heavy.
Pete—Pete, that was Jerome’s chum, his boyhood
chum. And I—I had to tell him Jerome was—was
dead. I—I just couldn’t tell him the—the truth.”</p>

<p>The queer old desert rat broke into a gale of insane
laughter. “Mark me! Cuss-durn me, you
mark me, Agatha!” he squeaked excitedly, his
watery eyes afire. He trotted up to her side and
shook a dried claw of a finger into her face. “Mark
ye! Let Jerome boy git clear of that scalawag
politician sheriff, an’ he’ll be off like a jackrabbit!
Hain’t I learned him how to hide an’ go seek
in that sand pile? Eh, hain’t I? Glory be, she’s
a grand sand pile, Agatha! An’ he knows her,
Jerome does—every hide-out, every water hole, the
ol’ Injun trails, the ornery tricks of her an’—an’
there’s scores on scores of box cañons, that he
knows, that he kin crawl out of an’ give Mr. Sheriff
the hoss laugh. Yes, he kin. An’ nobody knows
’em, but me an’ him. Wommin! He’ll be off like
a jackrabbit, I tell ye, wunst he’s in the clear.”
He paused, glaring about the room. The canvas
sack he had thrown in the corner caught his eye.
“There’s the rock he asked you to have me git him,
Agatha. It’s lousy—plumb lousy with gold, d’ye
mark? An’ the ledge’ll go down to hell, she’s that
true. I’ve called her the ‘Billy Geerusalem,’” he
added in a furious whisper.</p>

  CHAPTER IX—EVIDENCE TO CONVICT
</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, Lex Sangerly met the two railroad
detectives and, after a short conference
in the hotel office, the three motored out to the
Huntington ranch. It was around four o’clock
when they admitted themselves into the house with
the key Lemuel had placed under the doormat. The
sleuths, Ray Coates and Harry Tyler—former plain-clothes
men of the Los Angeles police department—began
an exhaustive investigation of the grounds
and outhouses. They found the tracks of Billy
Gee approaching the ranch from across the plains
and even traced the outlaw’s progress into the
dwelling. It required painstaking effort to do this
last, and the continued use of a magnifying glass
by which they followed the disconnected, faint trail
of blood specks, from the spot where Dot had
dragged the wounded bandit out of the saddle until
she finally got him indoors. These two Mohave &amp; Southwestern
bloodhounds also established the incriminating
fact that Billy Gee had occupied the
parlor lounge. To them, it was a cinch case, circumstantial
evidence pointing conclusively to the
outlaw having received aid either from Lemuel or
his daughter.</p>

<p>As for Lex, he had lingered inside. He had made
two discoveries, both impressive ones. Wandering
into Huntington’s room, he had come upon a photograph
of a girl. It was standing on the bureau—a
photograph of Dot taken a year before in Geerusalem
and showing her in the first full bloom
of charming womanhood. He picked up the picture
and looked at it for a long time. It engrossed
him in an odd way, for he was struck by the
freshness and sensitiveness of the face, by the
wholesome, gentle expression in the great eyes,
withal, by that indefinable charm that attaches only
to things of desert life, be they a humble wild
flower, a mocking bird’s nest in a cactus, or a
daughter of the range.</p>

<p>Curiosity led him at last to steal a glance into
the room this remarkably pretty girl occupied. He
entered it rather hesitatingly and surveyed its interior.
It was a clean little room, plainly furnished,
but there were artistic touches of color here and
there that gave it a peculiar cheer and warmth, and
in a frame against the wall was a picture of Mrs.
Agatha Liggs! The sight of that picture pleased
him. It did more. The longer he gazed at it, the
greater became that pleasure and, though he did
not pause to ascertain the cause, he felt himself
grow kindly inclined toward this stranger girl, as
if, in some unknown way, he already knew her.</p>

<p>Presently he made his second discovery. Inspecting
the scarcely visible, bloody finger prints
of a man on the window sill, he straightway satisfied
himself that their owner had climbed out of
Dot’s room through the window. Further investigation
of the soft soil of the garden beneath that
window revealed not only a man’s tracks, but a
woman’s, the latter’s showing that she had both
left and reëntered the house by the same route.</p>

<p>For some moments Lex stood and thought gravely
over this new angle in the case. There was no
blinking the fact that Billy Gee had been befriended
and that his benefactor was quite obviously
Dot Huntington. It seemed incredible, judging
from the high praise Mrs. Liggs had accorded
the girl—and he knew Mrs. Liggs’ stanch regard
for the truth.</p>

<p>Yet here was irrefutable proof pointing to a
wounded man escaping from the house, assisted
by a woman, who—it was a natural deduction in
the circumstances—after she had seen him safely
away, returned to her room by a route plainly intended
to conceal her actions; and the only apparent
reason for secrecy, as far as he could see,
appeared to be fear of discovery by some one in
the house, that some one being Lemuel Huntington.
Granting this were true, it was more than probable
that a love affair existed between this notorious
desperado and the rancher’s daughter, of which her
father was ignorant; for, Lex argued, no girl, unless
she were deeply interested in him, would be so
indiscreet as to clamber through a window, out of
her own bedroom, with a man, shot and bleeding,
a man, whose presence in the house she dared not
reveal to her father.</p>

<p>The footsteps of the two detectives on the back
porch, disturbed his train of thought. Presently
he heard the pair tramping about the kitchen. A
few moments later, Coates—a hard-eyed, poker-faced
individual, never without a cigar in his
mouth—threw open the door and walked in.</p>

<p>“We found the saddlebags, saddle and bridle, Mr.
Sangerly. They’re smeared over with blood. Somebody
hid ’em pretty carefully,” he announced, with
a cocksure jerk of his head.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In the barn. The bags were in the loft, covered
over with hay. The saddle, Tyler dug up from
under a pile of old gunny sacks. There’s a bed
been made in the loft, and somebody ate lunch
there not later’n yesterday. There’s soft bread
crumbs layin’ around.”</p>

<p>“Then our theory that Billy Gee cached the
money here is about right, isn’t it?” said Lex
quietly.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world,” sniggered Coates. “And
what’s more, he had a swell little accomplice to
help him put it over.”</p>

<p>Tyler entered the room at this juncture. He
was a ferretlike, wiry man, smileless and resolute
of eye, with a close-cropped, iron-gray mustache
and a permanent frown.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to it, Mr. Sangerly. We’ve got
enough evidence to pinch Huntington and his daughter
on suspicion,” he said crisply. “It’s a cinch
Billy Gee got all kinds of help here. We’ve established
the fact he rode up here from across country
and was dragged into the house by a woman
who doctored him on the parlor couch. At the
back of the barn, just outside the door, we find a
coupla rolled-up blankets tied for slinging over the
shoulder with this,” holding up two strips of calico
for the other’s inspection; “and in the kitchen is
the apron this cloth was torn from. Now my
theory is that Huntington’s daughter——”</p>

<p>“I can’t see that it makes much difference, now
that this bandit has been captured, whether he received
aid or not,” interrupted Lex. “It’s not improbable
that he was given help. When a man is
wounded, people as a rule don’t stop to ask questions.
But I don’t think it follows that Billy Gee
would tell any one what was in his saddlebags.
You seem to forget you’re dealing with a cold-blooded
professional highwayman with a price on
his head, not a sentimental novice. This chap isn’t
a movie bad man. He’s the real thing, as we have
good reason to know. If he cached that money on
this ranch, he did it alone——”</p>

<p>“I was going to say, Mr. Sangerly,” broke in
Tyler respectfully, in his turn, “that we can’t be
too awful sure of this girl not being wise. Billy
Gee’s record shows he’s a damn fool with his coin—gives
it away like a drunken Indian, that’s what
they say around camp.”</p>

<p>“After we have satisfied ourselves completely that
the money cannot be found, it will be time enough
to confront the girl, Tyler. It doesn’t seem quite
fair to me to accuse people of a thing of this
sort, to brand them accomplices of a criminal, when
they have opened their home to us as hospitably
as the Huntingtons have. Besides, Huntington is
the man whom we have to thank for capturing
Billy Gee when every one else failed. You might
as well say that this rancher made a double clean-up—got
away with the bandit’s swag and also collected
the reward.”</p>

<p>“That’s just exactly what I’ve been thinking,”
declared Coates stoutly; “and I agree with Tyler
that the girl is in on the deal. There’s some pretty
slick birds among these desert rats, Mr. Sangerly,
let me tell you. It’s damned funny to me why
they beat it out of the country, so all of a sudden.
It’s the Bunker Hill, if you want my opinion on
the matter.”</p>

<p>Lex gazed thoughtfully across the room, at the
picture of Mrs. Liggs.</p>

<p>“And supposing they’re sweethearts, sir,” ventured
Tyler. “It ain’t impossible. The police
records are crammed with stranger cases than that.
If they’re intimate, she’d be in on the game, wouldn’t
she? And it’d be the easiest thing going for her
to hide that twenty thousand where nobody’d find
it. Another thing, Billy Gee, according to all reports,
has either relatives or mighty close friends
in Soapweed Plains.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do, men,” said Lex finally.
“I’m going back to town to-night, and I’ll ascertain
all about Miss Huntington—if she has a sweetheart,
the type of girl she is, everything regarding
the family. In the meantime, drop this accomplice
business and settle down to a systematic, thorough
search.”</p>

<p>It was dusk when Lex stopped his machine before
Mrs. Liggs’ dry-goods store. The night life
of Geerusalem was beginning to waken, stretching
itself like some blinking giant making ready
to be off on his rampant adventuring. For five
crooked blocks down the wide gulch which sloped
gently out of the hills, onto the smooth floor of
Soapweed Plains, the main street was ablaze with
lights, pouring from business houses, saloons, gambling
houses, and dance halls. Already the sidewalks
were packed with as heterogeneous a stream
of humanity as may be seen only in those out-of-the-way
places of earth where men have discovered
fabulous wealth bursting from the rock.</p>

<p>Here swaggered the hordes of miners coming off
shift from a hundred working properties in the
neighboring hills, grimy, spattered with candle
grease, and adding to the bustle and confusion of
the gold-mad crowd, was the torrent of traffic that
surged up and down the rough, rocky thoroughfare—wagons
of every description from the slim
rattletrap buckboard, up through the various stages
of all known vehicles, great freighter’s outfits,
horse-drawn hacks, carts, automobiles; all these
contributed to the bedlam that roared through the
hills from early dawn to midnight, incessantly
from one day to another.</p>

<p>Lex stepped out of the roadster and began shouldering
his way across the sidewalk to Mrs. Liggs’
store. He suddenly noticed that the place was open,
the display window brilliantly lighted up, and he
made out over the heads of the throng, the figure
of the little proprietress bustling energetically about
behind the counter, waiting on customers. The
marked difference between his visit that afternoon,
when he had found the establishment closed and
its owner showing traces of prolonged grief, and
his present one, caused him to wonder curiously.
The next moment, however, an unlooked-for incident
drove the thought from his mind.</p>

<p>He had almost cleared the jam on the sidewalk
and was within a step of the store entrance, when
a man collided heavily with him. As he staggered
back into the arms of one of the crowd, a coarse
voice yelled in his ear:</p>

<p>“What the hell! Look where you’re going, you
poor fish!”</p>

<p>Lex got his feet and stood blocking the other’s
way, gazing steadily at him. The press of men
around them, sensing trouble, scattered like magic,
for it was no unusual thing for revolvers to flash
at the least provocation.</p>

<p>The man before him was big and powerfully
built, forty-five or thereabouts, with heavy face and
piercing, arrogant, coal-black eyes. His clothes—Norfolk
suit of the finest whipcord, silk shirt,
jaunty, stiff-brimmed Stetson and nap-a-tan half
boots of superior quality—his whole bearing, in
fact, stamped him a person of wealth and prominence.</p>

<p>There was a tragic silence. In that brief interval,
the center of the street was a solid mass of
staring humanity, the two principals standing alone,
the hub of a wide circle. Even Mrs. Liggs, attracted
by the sudden commotion, stood watching
now, pale and trembling, from the rear of the
store, her eyes riveted on the contestants facing
each other before her door.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better look where <i>you’re</i> going,
neighbor,” said Lex finally, in a dangerously quiet
tone.</p>

<p>The other’s lip curled, and his eyes flamed with
contempt. He sneered. “I see you don’t know who
you’re talking to——”</p>

<p>“I don’t care and have no desire to know,” cut
in Lex. “What I want to know is, are you looking
for trouble?”</p>

<p>The man regarded him hatefully before he spoke,
then he said in low, sibilant tones, intended only
for Lex’s ears. “One word from me—one signal—and
you’d be riddled with bullets where you stand.
I don’t like you, stranger, because you’re just that,
a stranger. But I admire an equal, able and willing
to fight for his rights. You say you don’t care
to know me. You ask me if I’m looking for
trouble. You haven’t got a chance in the world
against me. Look for yourself!”</p>

<p>Without averting his gaze from Lex’s face, he
raised his voice: “Hey, gang! Quintell men come
forward!”</p>

<p>A sudden movement ran over the multitude. The
open circle began filling rapidly, as scores of
hitherto curious onlookers obeyed the order. They
halted, silent and ominous—members of that army
of undesirables which forms a large percentage of
the population of every new mining camp—and
focused their hard eyes on Lex.</p>

<p>The man chuckled easily. “You’re a stranger in
camp and don’t appreciate what it means to brush
up against Jule Quintell. I hope we understand
each other—that we’ll spare each other future embarrassment,”
he said, with biting emphasis.</p>

<p>Dismissing his followers with a wave of his
hand, he turned on his heel and strode away. Lex,
furious with chagrin, looked after him for some
seconds, then he entered the little dry-goods store.</p>

<p>“Oh, deary!” burst out Mrs. Liggs, hurrying up
to him. She closed and locked the front door, and
taking his hand in her own trembling one, started
leading him toward the rear of the place. “I
nearly fainted with fright, Lex. Do you know
who he was? Jule Quintell, honey, the awfulest
man. He’s the worst crook, controls the camp, and
is that powerful he just laughs at law and order.
Men are killed off like flies, and they say Jule
Quintell is back of every murder. Oh, it’s terrible,
Lex! Nobody is safe, and he’s got spies all around,
and they jump mining claims, and if the owner
shows fight, they shoot him like a dog. I was
just scared to death.”</p>

<p>She made him comfortable in the cozy living
room and chattered on, recounting the lawless deeds
of “Boss” Quintell and his gangster following.</p>

<p>“One of these days he’ll get what’s coming to
him, Mother Liggs. He’ll pick on the wrong man
at the right time,” said Lex slowly.</p>

<p>A little later, they had dismissed the subject and
their talk drifted to the search being made on the
Huntington ranch.</p>

<p>“Developments have brought about a rather unusual
situation,” he told her, “and I have come
to you, hoping you might be able to clear it up. In
the first place, I want to ask you a question, because
I know you are an intimate friend of the
Huntingtons. I saw your picture occupying a prominent
place out there. Has Miss Huntington a
sweetheart? Have you ever known her to be interested
in any man?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Liggs thought a moment, then shook her
head decidedly. “No, and what’s more, she never
speaks of men in that way, Lex. She’s different
from any girl I’ve ever met, for her age—she’s
eighteen. She’s studious and likes to read novels
and—well, dream. She sits and spins yarns to me
every time we visit one another. Yarns she’s
made up, mind you, and they’re as clever as any
you ever read. But I’m positive she never kept
company with a man in her life. I’d know if
she did, Lex.”</p>

<p>He looked across the room, puffing his cigarette
in silence.</p>

<p>“The reason I ask, Mother Liggs, is that our
investigations lead us to believe that she helped
Billy Gee, provided him with food, a bed and——”</p>

<p>“She did!” burst out the little old lady, in sudden
excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, and from all appearances, hid him in her
room. I want to be sure of their relations to each
other, for it is quite probable that if he knew her
he would tell her about the stolen money and
either confide in her where he had hidden it or
have her conceal it for him.” He followed by giving
Mrs. Liggs a detailed account of the search
and what it had revealed.</p>

<p>She listened intently, eagerly, drinking in every
word, a strange, exultant light that he did not
note gleaming far back in the depths of her faded
blue eyes, her cheeks tinged with a faint rosiness
that heightened the charm of her kindly countenance.</p>

<p>“And if you don’t find this money, Lex, I hope
you don’t intend to arrest Dot!” she cried suddenly.
“Why, that would be a terrible outrage—horrible.
That girl is a dear, sweet, innocent child who
wouldn’t do wrong for anything. Why, that’s just
like her to help him—wounded and bleeding and
all that!”</p>

<p>He smiled at her vehement defense of the girl.
“I don’t think we will have occasion to go that
far in the matter, Mother Liggs,” he said reassuringly.
“As I was driving in from the ranch it
struck me that, confronted with what evidence we
have and more that we’ll get, showing that Miss
Huntington presumably aided him, Billy Gee will
confess—make a clean breast of everything, rather
than have her incriminated. Any man would, out
of a sense of gratitude, if for no other reason.”
He paused and added slowly: “Personally, from
everything you’ve told me about her I don’t believe
a young woman of Miss Huntington’s standing
would stoop to such a thing as keeping stolen
money—supposing, of course, that Billy Gee turned
it over to her. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Liggs did not reply. She studied him curiously
for a few seconds, then she said gravely:</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen the bulletin board this afternoon,
have you? Well, Billy Gee escaped from
Sheriff Warburton and—and got away, Lex. If
you’ll stay to supper I’ll tell you all about it. And
I’ve got—what do you think, deary? Pumpkin pie!
Only it’s made out of canned pumpkin.” Laughing,
she took both his hands in hers and drew
him into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='mt10'>A hundred miles southwest of Geerusalem, where
the Mohave Desert grudgingly recedes and the great
arable belt, rich in orange and lemon groves, orchard
and vineyard, follows the coast line unswervingly,
north and south, a dozen posses were scouring
the country for one man.</p>

<p>Four hours before, Billy Gee had turned on
Sheriff Warburton in the lavatory of the smoking
car and struck him down with the heavy “bottle-cuffs”
that shackled his hands. He had taken the
key from the unconscious official’s pocket, unlocked
the manacles, slipped them on Warburton, and
gagged him so that he could not cry out. Then
he had leaped through the lavatory window, while
the train was straining on an upgrade, out of the
desert.</p>

<p>At the next station, a brakeman had discovered
the sheriff lying helpless on the floor. The train
was stopped, the wires tapped, and the alarm
broadcasted around for hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>Sheriff Warburton, overwhelmed with humiliation,
raging impotently, mustered a posse and began
combing the neighborhood where his prisoner
had broken for freedom. Other posses were organized.
A dragnet, twenty-five miles in diameter,
started closing in. Hour after fruitless hour passed.
On the evening of the same day that he had left
Geerusalem with the notorious bandit in custody,
Sheriff Warburton, baffled, discomfited, offered one
thousand dollars for the man’s capture, dead or
alive.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock that night, when it seemed certain
that Billy Gee had dropped from sight, Warburton
wrapped up his gold-filled star of authority, together
with his credentials and a letter, resigning as sheriff
of San Buenaventura County. These he mailed to
the chairman of the board of supervisors, but he
did not abandon his hunt for Billy Gee. On the
contrary, he prosecuted that hunt with a persistence
bordering on frenzy, spending days and nights in
the saddle, sleeping and eating only when exhaustion
threatened to put him out of the running, and
he registered a violent oath against the outlaw,
if they ever should meet again.</p>

<p>Two weeks later the newspapers carried a story
about the finding of a dead man in a lonely desert
cañon, some distance from the little town of Burbank.
Authorities differed as to the length of time
the man had been dead. Identification proving
quite impossible, it was, nevertheless, decided that
the remains were those of Billy Gee. Ex-Sheriff
Warburton alone would not believe it. He continued
his relentless, indefatigable search.</p>

  CHAPTER X—A DISCLOSURE
</h2>

<p>Dot Huntington found San Francisco to exceed
her wildest imaginings of what a great
city really was. Born of the desert and having
been an intimate part of that desert all her life
and, until the establishment of Geerusalem, knowing
nothing of those centers where men forgathered
and schemed and battled and died in a fury of
commercial competition, she had always pictured a
metropolis as similar to an ant hill for life and
activity; but she had never thought it so spectacular,
so dynamic in potentialities, so gigantic a thing
as that architectural pile which greeted her eyes
on that memorable morning when she and her
father crossed the seven miles of green bay from
Oakland, toward the picturesque horizon of buildings
rising step on step, miles long and wide, tier
on tier, up the steep slopes of hills that hid their
crests in a low-lying, fleecy bank of fog.</p>

<p>And Market Street, Mississippian in its aspect,
flowing full with its surging, irresistible stream of
pedestrians and traffic, appalled her. The chaotic
blockade of street cars at the Ferry terminal, the
deafening thunder and shriekings of the busy Embarcadero,
the mad confusion of it all, bewildered
her—and bewildered Lemuel still more.</p>

<p>It was during the period when the Golden West
Hotel was to the country people of California what
the Congress, in Chicago, is to the political world
of the nation—the one and only caravansary. Accordingly,
Lemuel set his blind course for the
Golden West Hotel. He did this after making a
number of inquiries on how to reach his destination,
regarding with considerable suspicion each
one of his informants, for he had heard about the
suaveness of confidence and bunko men and their
artful way of misdirecting their victims to dens of
iniquity, abounding in trapdoors and subterranean
dungeons and murderous gangsters, and he felt
that he was just a trifle too smart to fall a prey
to the sly brotherhood.</p>

<p>“Them slick fellers’s got to git up purty early
in the mornin’ to beat yore dad, Dot,” he grinned
proudly, as they started off in a taxi. “I ain’t up
on city ways, but I’m kinder foxy myself. That’s
what comes of knockin’ around with Lennox, the
minin’ engineer, an’ the rest of them Geerusalem
sports, like I’ve done.”</p>

<p>But with all Lemuel’s belief in his own sagacity,
when it was a matter of pitting his wits against the
other fellow’s, he failed to notice that, ever since
their arrival at the Ferry terminal, he and Dot had
been the object of intense secret interest on the
part of a man who, once his sharp eyes rested
on them as they came in sight with the rest of
the passengers, trailed them about until they entered
the taxi.</p>

<p>He was a broad-shouldered, powerful individual,
perhaps in the late thirties, with a red, coarse face
and expressionless blue eyes. His clothes were cut
along flashy lines, his shoes of glittering patent
leather, his hat worn jauntily. But his very appearance,
particularly when he walked, somehow
impressed one that he was more at home in the
hills than in the city. As Dot and her father began
their slow progress up Market Street the stranger
sprang into another taxi and instructed the driver
to follow the first.</p>

<p>Arriving at the hotel, Lemuel and his daughter
registered and were shown to a cheerful little suite
overlooking the street. They sat down in the parlor
and stared at each other.</p>

<p>“My!” exclaimed Dot breathlessly. “Isn’t this
just—just wonderful?”</p>

<p>“Geerusalem ain’t got nuthin’ on this burg, has
it? Sounds like ol’ hell broke loose—an’ I’m not
cussin’ when I say that, Dot,” chuckled Lemuel.</p>

<p>Her eyes kindled, and she rose from her chair and
went over and threw her arms around his neck.
“It’s such a glorious adventure. I—I only wish
poor mother was with us. Don’t you, daddy?”</p>

<p>He didn’t answer for some seconds, then he said
in a strained voice: “That’s the one thing that
spoils it all for us, honey—her not bein’ here. All
her life, she looked for’ard to this hour, when me
an’ her’d bring you to Frisco to go to school.
Thank God, the hour’s come—anyway!”</p>

<p>During the next two days they devoted themselves
almost entirely to getting acquainted with the
vicinity of the hotel. Then they began taking short
tours of investigation, growing bolder and bolder
until they were finally promenading the miles of
streets which form the downtown business section,
even venturing a trip to the Cliff House where
they spent hours gazing in speechless amazement
across the Pacific—the first ocean they had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Having become thus partially inured to metropolitan
conditions, they found time to think of other
matters. Naturally enough, it was Lemuel’s desire
to get his daughter an outfit; the best that money
could buy would be none too good, he told himself.
That daughter, like any woman, was not averse to
being prettily clothed, so they started window shopping,
staring at the gorgeous displays along lower
Grant Avenue, trying to decide on what would be
not alone stylish, but attractive and worth the money
as well.</p>

<p>But by the end of the fourth day it became quite
apparent to them both that choosing a young lady’s
first wardrobe destined to give her the required
distinction demanded by so select an institution as
Longwell’s Seminary was clearly not a job for
the uninitiated. They repaired to their little parlor
to study over the problem. Lemuel was smoking
his after-dinner cigar and frowning at his new
tight shoes.</p>

<p>“I have it, daddy!” burst out Dot suddenly, breaking
a long silence. “Telegraph to Mrs. Liggs and
ask her to come. You can pay her fare and expenses.
You remember, she used to live in San
José and she knows all about what is proper and
tasty in dress. She can get somebody to take care
of the store for a few days. I’m sure she’ll come.”</p>

<p>But Lemuel shook his head severely. “We don’t
want Mrs. Liggs pickin’ out yore things, Dot, an’
that settles it,” he said shortly.</p>

<p>“Why not? She’s in the dry-goods business and
knows all about clothes.”</p>

<p>“She’s old-fashioned, that’s why, an’ she wouldn’t
talk to me when I seen her——”</p>

<p>“She is not old-fashioned, daddy, and you know
it,” cried Dot spiritedly. “Didn’t she make me that
pretty pink dress last summer, and everybody admired
it? You said yourself it was nicer than anything
you’d seen on me. I know that if we try
to buy a wardrobe ourselves, they’ll——&#160;Well, we’ll
have to take what they tell us is the latest style,
because we don’t know any better. Can’t you see
that you’ll save money and everything by having
Mrs. Liggs come? Please send for her, daddy!”</p>

<p>They discussed the matter for upward of an
hour, and because her father’s objections were
weak and unconvincing, Dot argued all the more
strenuously in an effort to have her way. Nor was
Lemuel so greatly opposed to her plan as he pretended
to be. He firmly believed that Mrs. Liggs
was the very person who could discriminate between
what was modish and what was not in a
young lady’s apparel, and that, furthermore, she
would not hesitate to close up her store for a week
and board the first train north if she knew that
Dot required her services in a matter of such
moment.</p>

<p>What he was endeavoring to do was make up
his mind whether he should tell his daughter how
he had captured Billy Gee, confess his perfidy, and
send for Mrs. Liggs, or object flatly to her and,
thereby, throw himself on the tender mercies of
some clerk trained in the subtle art of selling
goods; for he realized only too well, that were
their little old friend to come, she would lose no
time in telling Dot about the sensational capture of
the bandit, and how he, Lemuel, had been lionized
by the population of Geerusalem. Under other circumstances
he would have rather welcomed this,
but to have his daughter learn how treacherously
he had acted, was something he dreaded. He felt
that she would not be able to understand his object
back of the act. Again, Mrs. Liggs’ unaccountable
treatment of him that morning when he rode into
Geerusalem rankled considerably. Of course, he
told himself, there was always the possibility that
she had not recognized him, for her eyes were not
as keen now as he had once known them to be.</p>

<p>So, after finding himself being slowly convinced
by Dot almost against his will that they were absolutely
dependent on Mrs. Liggs to solve the wardrobe
problem for them, he finally yielded to his
half-formed notion to tell his daughter everything—except
the fact that Billy Gee had threatened his
life; for he would not awaken unnecessary fears
in her lest she might refuse to attend school.</p>

<p>He cleared his throat presently and said: “I’m
goin’ to tell you somepn, Dot—because I’d ruther
you heard it from me than an outsider—an’ I want
you to forgive me for carin’ more for yore future
than for yore opinion of yore old dad.” He paused
and glanced anxiously at her. “I ketched Billy Gee
as he was leavin’ the barn that night, an’—an’ I
c’llected the ten thousand dollars reeward.”</p>

<p>She had been sitting on the arm of his chair,
smoothing his thin, gray hair, idly. Now she
started suddenly, and a hard gasp escaped her.
Rising from her seat, she came around in front
of him and stood looking sharply down into his
face.</p>

<p>“You turned him over—over to Sheriff Warburton?”
she asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I did, Dot—to git the money to give you an
edjucation. I had to lie to you, much as it hurt.
But—but he got away. He jumped off the train
an’ they ain’t bin able to find hide or hair of him,”
he added, grinning expectantly at her.</p>

<p>“He got away! He got away—again—from
Sheriff Warburton!”</p>

<p>“Yeh. An’ plumb disappeared. I bin watchin’
the papers. Poor Bob was so bruck up over losin’
him, he quit the sheriff job.”</p>

<p>She stared intently at him a moment, then threw
back her head and laughed aloud—a silvery, daring
laugh.</p>

<p>“I’m glad! Oh, I’m so glad!” she cried, a catch in
her throat.</p>

<p>Lemuel was gazing narrowly at her, missing
nothing; and he noticed the warm flush come and
go in her cheeks. He had never seen such a brilliant
light in her eyes before. He marveled vaguely.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t glad, that’s sure,” he said at last,
with a hollow chuckle, but the significance of his
words was lost on her.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it, daddy. And you got all
that money for—for capturing him? And he’s free?
I’ll forgive you, then.”</p>

<p>Whereupon, he began an apologetic confession,
relating how he had suspected that she knew the
hiding place of the bandit, how he had spied on
her, followed her from the house and seen her
mount the steps into the hayloft, on that memorable
night; how he had surprised Billy Gee and delivered
him over to Warburton; how he had returned home
by way of the field and climbed into bed.</p>

<p>Dot listened in silence, her eyes averted, an odd
sympathy in her face; but she fairly gloated over
the paper which Lemuel had carefully preserved,
giving the stirring particulars of the outlaw’s subsequent
escape.</p>

<p>“You’ll notice it says that the twenty thousand
dollars he stole from the paymaster is missin’,” said
Lemuel pointedly. Her obvious interest in Billy Gee
disturbed him. “Ain’t it funny how it’s got lost?
What d’ye reckon could ’a’ happened to it, eh, Dot?”</p>

<p>She glanced up from her reading and found him
studying her strangely. She thought there was
deep suspicion in his look. Or was it craftiness,
greed?</p>

<p>The recollection of that wild outburst of his in
the kitchen, back home, flashed into her mind.
Much as she despised herself for the feeling of
distrust that kindled in her breast, she decided she
couldn’t be sure of him, that he was not to be
relied on. Regardless of the fact that he now had
money, might he still not be tempted—particularly
since no one had the remotest inkling of the whereabouts
of the bandit’s loot—to keep it, if she confided
in him that Billy Gee had left it for her and
that she was only waiting an opportunity to return
it to its rightful owners? It was a frightful
thought, she knew—a base, horrible thought for a
daughter to entertain toward a father so self-sacrificing
and loving as he was—but try as she would
she could not rid herself of it.</p>

<p>“It is funny, isn’t it? Don’t you suppose, though,
that they’ll make a search for it?” she asked, her
innocence well assumed. There was a curious interest
back of the last question, but he failed to
notice it, watching as he was for some sign of
nervousness or apprehension in her face.</p>

<p>“They already started. A young feller named
Sangerly—his old man’s manager of the road—he’s
bin on the job sence the day we left. He’s got a
coupla high-class deetectives along. ’Cordin’ to what
he was tellin’ me he aims to make it poorty hot
for somebody.” He said this significantly.</p>

<p>She laughed. “You don’t mean that he suspects
who has the money? That’s——”</p>

<p>“He’s got it figgered out that Billy Gee had it
with him when he come to our place—an’ he’s
dead right, let me tell you. When I deelivered that—the
cuss to Bob Warburton that mornin’, he
didn’t have no more’n five dollars on him. I know,
’cos I seen Bob search him. Sangerly says he
cached the twenty thousand on the ranch.” He
paused and added in low, confidential tones: “Say,
Dot, you don’t happen to know about it, do you?
You seen his saddlebags, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied evenly. “He had his saddlebags
with him, and when I asked him what they
contained, he said simply that he always carried
his mother’s picture and some keepsakes along with
him. He may have left them in the barn—forgotten
them. I really couldn’t say. Did you look?”</p>

<p>“No, goldarn it! I wisht now I’d hunted around
for ’em. I reckon Sangerly’ll find them. But, anyhow
I’m glad you ain’t goin’ to git mixed up in
this mess, hon. It’d be turrible! The paper’d
print yore name, an’ mebby yore pitcher’d git in,
an’—jest think what a disgrace it’d be! Like as
not, you’d git chucked out o’ school. Folks’d talk
awful, you bein’ c’nnected up with a train robber.
An’ no matter what you’d say wouldn’t do no good.
People’d turn up their nose an’ say, ‘She’s no better’n
he is.’” He glanced at his watch and got to
his feet. “All right, we’ll send for Agatha. What’ll
we tell her?”</p>

<p>Between them they worded the telegram, Dot
writing it; and presently he left the room with it,
bound for the hotel office.</p>

<p>Once alone, the girl began again to ponder on
what she should do with the fortune she had
wrapped in her mother’s old silk shawl. Ever
since their arrival in San Francisco, her interest
in other things had, for the time being, surmounted
the responsibility and concern she felt as the unwilling
custodian of this large sum of stolen money.
Her father’s words now recalled the question to
her in a most vivid way.</p>

<p>It had all seemed so easy on the train—merely
the inconvenience of going to the police station,
sheriff’s office, or postmaster, turning the loot over
to one of the three, with the information that it
represented what Billy Gee had stolen from the
paymaster of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad,
and that she wished it returned to the company.</p>

<p>Here and now, however, amidst all this great
city’s mad rush and confusion, she shrank from
taking this step. After due reflection, it struck
her that in all probability she would be closely
questioned, and the fearful notion grew on her
that there was more than a likelihood that she
would be arrested as an accomplice; she had heard
of just such things having been done. And, even
as her father had said, there was the notoriety
she was of a certainty to receive in the newspapers.
Yes, everybody would believe she was a friend of
this man whose name stood for lawlessness. They
might believe she was——&#160;She shivered at the
thought. What, then, must she do to save the
romantic situation for herself?</p>

<p>Racking her brains, she sat down and finally hit
on another solution. She would wait until Mrs.
Liggs arrived. She would confide in this dear
little old lady, who had been like a mother to her,
tell her everything, and ask her advice. Mrs. Liggs
would understand and help her.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, Lemuel returned with the proposal
that they attend a theater, and finish the
night with a sight-seeing trip through Chinatown.</p>

<p>“I bin hearin’ them Geerusalem sports braggin’
around about some new-fangled game called chop
sueys, that the chinks play, an’ I’m goin’ to take
a whirl at it ’fore I go back, even if I lose,” he
said, as he entered his room.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of their dressing, when
the hall doorbell rang. Lemuel answered it and
fell back with a gasp of amazement when he
recognized the smiling face of his visitor.</p>

<p>“Dick Lennox! Why, you ol’ son of a gun!
What’re you doin’? When, in heck, did you git
in?” he exploded, grasping the other by the hand
and drawing him into the room.</p>

<p>“This afternoon. Awfully glad to see you, Lem.
I’ve been on your trail ever since you left.”</p>

<p>Lemuel eyed him sharply. “How’s that? Anythin’
gone wrong?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing in the world that I know. Just
a matter of urgent business,” said Lennox.</p>

<p>He removed his nobby overcoat as he spoke, and
arranged his tie with fastidious care, smiling genially
at the other the while.</p>

<p>He was a tall, wiry chap of twenty-eight, the
stamp of college days still on him, rather prepossessing
of features, with shrewd blue eyes, and
blond hair slicked back. Lemuel noticed that he
had changed his corduroys and half-boots of Geerusalem
vogue for a snappy gray suit.</p>

<p>“Say, Lem, I’m about the luckiest cuss you ever
heard of,” he cried, throwing himself in a chair
and lighting a cigarette. “I combed the camp, as
the detectives say, but couldn’t get a line where
you’d gone. Then I butted into the guy that drove
you to Mirage. He thought you’d come to Frisco—overheard
you talking, I guess. But Frisco is
some bigger than Geerusalem, and I was euchred.
I was just figuring I’d have to give up and wait
till you returned, when I just happened to remember
you once mentioned the Golden West Hotel as
the place you’d stop at if you ever hit the city. I
took a chance, and here you are. Can you beat it?”</p>

<p>“I’d call it clever work, myself,” laughed Lemuel.</p>

<p>“Clever? Why, you old rascal, nothing is clever
alongside of what you did the other night—bringing
in Billy Gee, single-handed! Honest, I never thought
it was in you, Lem. The camp is still excited
over it.”</p>

<p>Lemuel crossed his legs with dignity and hooked
his thumbs in his armpits.</p>

<p>“I don’t guess there was as much to it as they
think,” he said, blowing a cloud of smoke toward
the ceiling. “Of course, a man was akcherly takin’
his life in his hands every minute, so to speak,
but you got to c’nsider I growed up fightin’ just
sech hard-boiled eggs. It’s all in knowin’ how to
handle ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly! Experience is a great teacher,”
conceded Lennox seriously and coughed into his
handkerchief to hide a grin.</p>

<p>Dot, attired for the street, joined them at this
juncture, and Lemuel presented Lennox.</p>

<p>“You remember me tellin’ you about Dick Lennox,
the minin’ engineer—the chap who introdooced
me to Mr. Sangerly? This is him, Dot. He come
all the way from Geerusalem to see——&#160;You said
somepn about business, Dick. What was it?”</p>

<p>“I believe that Miss Huntington is going out
for the evening,” said Lennox, with a glance at
Dot. “My errand can wait until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Wait—nuthin’, son—not after you come all the
way from Soapweed Plains! We got time galore.
Come on, what’s on yore mind?”</p>

<p>Lennox brought up a chair for the girl, seated
himself and said briskly: “What do you hold
your ranch at, Mr. Huntington?”</p>

<p>The other stared. “You mean, what’ll I sell fur?”</p>

<p>“Precisely—just as it stands.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, I don’t know as I ever figgered on
a price, Dick. I’ve always looked on it as home,
an’ a man gene’lly don’t——”</p>

<p>“I appreciate the way you feel—a place to hang
your hat and go to when you can’t go anywhere
else,” broke in Lennox genially. “But if you were
offered a—well, a handsome price. You’ll agree
with me that three hundred acres of it is worthless
desert, while most of the remaining twenty is little
better than pasture.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you c’nsider a handsome price?”
asked Lemuel skeptically.</p>

<p>His visitor thoughtfully flicked the ash off his
cigarette, into a tray.</p>

<p>“Say, seventy-five hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Seventy-five hundred!” burst out Lemuel. He
opened his mouth to laugh but, observing the seriousness
in the other’s face, the keenness with
which the blue eyes were studying him, closed it
again and rubbed his chin reflectively.</p>

<p>“You’ll admit that’s about double its value,” went
on Lennox, in matter-of-fact tones. “To be perfectly
frank, I have made inquiries, and find that
you just might turn it for fifteen dollars an acre—providing
you found the sort of person who
would put up with the discomforts of the desert,
some one looking for solitude and plenty of sun.
So far as a man making a living there, why——”</p>

<p>“D’ye mean cash down? I don’t go much on this
proposition of payments,” broke in the rancher.</p>

<p>“Cash—certainly. Furthermore, I’ve been authorized
to give you a substantial sum to bind the
bargain, our only stipulation being that the transfer
be made as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>A short silence fell.</p>

<p>“May I inquire, Mr. Lennox, the reason for this
flattering offer?” said Dot, speaking for the first
time. “Perhaps I should not ask the question but
I can’t help being curious——”</p>

<p>“You’re quite entitled to know, and I welcome the
opportunity to explain, Miss Huntington,” the man
replied affably. “You see, several of us have organized
what we call the Geerusalem Amusement
Company. Among a number of other prospective
enterprises, we intend to establish a resort—a place
of recreation a few miles out of camp, where people
can come and enjoy themselves. We have had
some choice places in view as a likely site—the
Las Animas Ranch and the Cañon Spring Ranch, for
instance—but we decided that your father’s was the
logical one, since it was the nearest from town and
correspondingly more available to the public.”</p>

<p>“That’s a poorty slick idea,” said Lemuel, with
an approving nod at Dot. “The ranch sure is handy,
an’——&#160;Funny I hadn’t thought of that before.”</p>

<p>“This resort, Mr. Lennox, what would it be like?
you certainly can’t mean a picnic ground or a
place for outings,” probed Dot, unable to visualize
anything of a particularly attractive nature about
her desert home.</p>

<p>Lennox shook his head. “I’m afraid you didn’t
quite catch my meaning. For one thing, we expect
to erect a bathhouse. By sinking wells in the bed
of the Mohave River, which passes through the
property, we feel satisfied we will strike a large
subterranean flow of water. We might even put
in a concrete pool, if the amount of water warrants
it. Anyhow, bathing facilities would be our big
drawing card. Added to it, of course, would be
a saloon, dance hall, gambling, doubtless a hotel,
should business demand it. In a word, we are
looking to construct a modern resort in the middle
of the desert. It’ll cost a barrel of money, but
we believe the venture a good one.”</p>

<p>Lemuel, in high spirits over the prospects of
disposing of his land for a price that, even as
Lennox had stated, was double its market value,
rubbed his hands with ill-concealed gratification.</p>

<p>“Dick, as the feller says, nuthin’ ventured’ll git
you nuthin’. Bein’ that you’ve bin out in the open
with me—laid yore hand on the table, so to
speak—I’ll jest call you. You give me seventy-five
hundred fur them two quarter sections, an’
they’re yourn——”</p>

<p>“Just one moment, father!” interrupted Dot.</p>

<p>During Lennox’s explanation of what the contemplated
resort was to be, she had sat with her
eyes fixed on the carpet at her feet, listening in
silence. Now she rose and stood before the two
men, her face set and just a trifle pale.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to sell the place, father,” she
continued, her voice low but firm. “You’re not
going to let them turn that clean spot into a
filthy hangout for the class of men and women
who’ll patronize it—where they’ll stagger around
drunk and curse and gamble and murder one another.”</p>

<p>Lemuel’s brows knit with impatience. “But can’t
you see, hon, this here’s big money. Dick knows
it an’ he knows <i>I</i> know it. We’ll never git another
chanct like it ag’in. An’ it’ll make us independent,
an’ we won’t ever have to go back there ’cept we
want to.”</p>

<p>“I really wouldn’t let my scruples stand in the
way of this deal, Miss Huntington,” advised Lennox
suavely. “While what you say may be perfectly
true, in a sense, at the same time you have
too much to gain to allow mere sentiment to swerve
you from what is clearly a duty you owe to yourselves—disposing
of the ranch for what is actually
a ridiculously high price.”</p>

<p>“Mere sentiment!” she echoed, her eyes flashing
with an odd light. “Of course, Mr. Lennox, you
don’t understand. You don’t know the reason I’m
objecting. With you, it’s a cold business proposition.”
She turned to Lemuel, watching her now
with obvious ill-humor. “Father, would you always
like to think that the drunkards and outcasts of
Geerusalem were merrymaking on the land where
poor mother worked and hoped and died? That
they were cursing and dancing and carousing within
hearing of her grave? That their drunken feet
were stumbling over it, desecrating it, day and
night, night and day? Would you like to think
that, for—for seventy-five hundred dollars——” Her
voice broke and she stood gazing at him beseechingly
through her tears.</p>

<p>For one instant, Lemuel stared aghast at her,
then sudden pain started in his eyes, twitched
down his face to his lips, and set them quivering.
He swallowed hard, looked guiltily at one callous
hand, and bowed his head.</p>

<p>“My God, Dick, she’s right!” he said hoarsely.
“I’d—I’d plumb forgot. I’m—I’m sorry, but I
reckon nobody’s got enough money to buy that ranch—not
fur a reesort, leastways. I sure—I sure
forgot. Dot, hon, you know I wouldn’t do sech an
awful thing, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Some minutes later, Lennox walked out of the
hotel and down the street. At the corner, a man
joined him—the same mysterious individual who
had followed Dot and her father from the Ferry
terminal on the morning they arrived in the city.</p>

<p>“I expect he fell heavy, eh?” laughed the fellow,
falling into step beside the other.</p>

<p>“No. He wouldn’t part with the place, Rankin,”
said Lennox quietly.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t! Not for seventy-five hundred!
What in hell does the old bum want for nothing?
What was his reason?”</p>

<p>“Just didn’t care to sell, that was all.”</p>

<p>Rankin gave a nasty chuckle. “Wait till Jule
hears about it. He’ll make that old buzzard sweat
blood, let me tell you! He’ll be glad to sell—for
nothing. Why, say, for all that coin, he ought
to have throwed in the skirt for good measure.
Maybe, Jule could use her—as his stenographer.”</p>

<p>Lennox stopped suddenly and confronted the other.</p>

<p>“What was that, Rankin?” he asked, peering hard
at him.</p>

<p>“I said the Huntington kid might have to go to
work for Jule as a stenographer, before he’s
through with her father,” was the surly response.</p>

<p>“Miss Huntington does not enter into this thing.
Do you understand that?” said Lennox harshly.</p>

<p>They continued in silence down the street and
came to a halt before the Western Union telegraph
office.</p>

<p>“I’m taking the morning train back to Geerusalem,”
announced Rankin. “Before I go, I want
to say one thing, and that is—I didn’t know you
were interested in Dot Huntington or I wouldn’t
have made the crack I did.” He paused and added
meaningly: “I don’t think Jule did either, or he
certainly wouldn’t have sent you to put through this
deal. It’ll be up to you to convince him why it
fell through when it shouldn’t have. You get me,
don’t you?” With a curt nod, he turned on his
heel and walked away.</p>

<p>Lennox looked after him for a moment, then he
entered the telegraph office. As he prepared to
send a wire to Jule Quintell he muttered to himself:
“I don’t blame them for refusing. She’s a wonderful
little girl.”</p>

  CHAPTER XI—OUTWITTED
</h2>

<p>On the day following Billy Gee’s spectacular
escape from Sheriff Warburton, Coates and
Tyler, the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad detectives,
temporarily abandoned their search for the
suspected cache on the Huntington ranch, and
motored away over the fifty-odd miles to the station
of Mirage, backtracking the bandit’s course to the
distant grading camp where he had robbed the paymaster’s
car.</p>

<p>At Lex Sangerly’s request, the Geerusalem constable—an
official regarded more as an ornament
than as a legal necessity in the township—detailed
a number of his deputies to guard the ranch against
the possibility of Billy Gee’s return; for Sangerly
was more convinced now than ever that the disappearance
of the twenty thousand dollars centered
around the Huntington place. He reasoned, therefore,
that the bandit, if alive, would come back
after it.</p>

<p>The morning after Lemuel sent the telegram to
Mrs. Liggs asking her to join him and Dot in San
Francisco, for the purpose of selecting the girl’s
wardrobe, the little dry-goods storekeeper had informed
Lex, when he voiced his surprise at her
trunks and suit cases being loaded on a freight
wagon, that she was leaving for the metropolis to
be gone an indefinite period. A few days later,
however, he learned that Mrs. Liggs had sold out
her business. He wondered vaguely, regretfully,
over this. It seemed to him that she at least might
have told him of her plans. He couldn’t understand
it. It was not like her—certainly, not like the
Mrs. Liggs he had known in the past, the wistful
little woman whom he had found again and still
loved, second only to his dead mother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Coates and Tyler back from their
painstaking, arduous investigation of the route Billy
Gee had taken from the grading camp into Soapweed
Plains, reported to Sangerly that, even as
Warburton had stated, there was not the remotest
likelihood that the outlaw had hidden his stealings
on the way. They had found that he had not dismounted
once throughout his long heartbreaking
ride.</p>

<p>This discovery simply served to strengthen all
the more the theory that the ranch was the site
of the missing loot, and again these two sleuths
set diligently to work to find it, making an exhaustive
hunt of the premises, exploring the barn
from mudsill to rafter, prying into every nook
and corner of the house, wielding the pick and
shovel in the garden, the corrals, the field, questing
with the ardor of bloodhounds each spot or locality
where a man would be tempted to conceal a stolen
fortune.</p>

<p>After a week of this, they talked the matter over
between themselves and they agreed that by all the
signs Lemuel Huntington knew more about the
disappearance of the money than any other living
man—not even excepting Billy Gee. They were
absolutely convinced that, while his daughter might
have acted solely from humanitarian reasons in
giving aid to the wounded outlaw, her father unquestionably
had not only collected the reward for
capturing the fellow but had succeeded in getting
possession of the contents of the saddlebags as well.</p>

<p>It was obvious, they argued, that since Huntington
had taken Billy Gee into custody so easily—desperadoes,
their experience told him, did not submit
without a struggle—he had doubtless been shrewd
enough to study the bandit’s movements for some
time prior to getting the drop on him. Such being
apparently the case, it followed then that Dot’s
father had seen the outlaw cache his stealings;
and after delivering his prisoner to Warburton,
he had returned home and robbed the cache, feeling
himself secure in the belief that Billy Gee would,
in all probability, go to jail without divulging
the hiding place of a treasure whose value was
such as to assure him of a comfortable stake against
the day of his release, providing, of course, it
was never found. Moreover, Coates and Tyler began
to discern where Huntington’s hurried trip to
San Francisco was the result of sudden panic,
brought on by the haunting thought that in some
way suspicion might fasten on him and that he
might be made the object of a rigid examination
which, he felt, he could not undergo. Coupled
with this notion, was their prevailing belief that
Huntington had taken the twenty thousand dollars
away with him.</p>

<p>However, Coates and Tyler said nothing of all this
to Sangerly. They were of the opinion that Lex
was altogether too lenient in his judgment of
Lemuel Huntington; that he was letting Huntington’s
seeming hospitality stand in the way of those
suspicions which, they were positive, he must
have entertained against the rancher. Secretly, they
began to regard their superior with a sort of pitying
scorn for his obvious gullibility. Their criminal-hunting
instincts, too, started rebelling at being
held in leash, at being hindered in their functioning
by the dictations of a man whose faith in human
nature was, to all intents and purposes, destined
to bring about the ultimate failure of the case—immunity
for Huntington, the loss of the money.</p>

<p>Brooding thus, becoming more and more disgusted
with their fruitless search of the ranch,
these two conscientious investigators resolved to
take matters in their own hands, at the risk of
incurring Sangerly’s displeasure and receiving a
reprimand into the bargain. They decided that,
unknown to him, they would arrest Lemuel on his
return, charge him with having made away with
the twenty thousand dollars, threaten him with disgrace—anything
that would terrorize him, wring
a confession from him.</p>

<p>But inquiry of the man who was caring for
the ranch during the absence of the Huntingtons
brought the disturbing information that, not only
was he ignorant of the family’s whereabouts in
San Francisco, but he had not the slightest idea
when Dot and her father would return. Coates
and Tyler, their plans balked at the outset, went
back to their half-hearted search, waiting grimly
for the arrival of their victim.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lex had likewise been giving considerable
thought to the mysterious disappearance
of his company’s money. He also was beginning
to recognize the necessity of carefully questioning
Lemuel, as well as his daughter, on the entire
Billy Gee episode. While he did not believe they
were accomplices of the bandit in any sense of
the word, or even knew him for that matter, he
felt convinced that it was quite possible that their
stories would shed some light on Billy’s movements
which would facilitate the search Coates and Tyler
were making, resulting probably in immediately
locating the whereabouts of the outlaw’s cache,
for, though he would not admit it to himself, he
saw where their quest was rapidly reaching an end,
that it had seemingly been for naught.</p>

<p>Ever since the departure of Dot and her father,
Lex had made it his business to ascertain the
standing of the Huntingtons, in order to fully
satisfy his mind as to the type of persons they
were. He had done this quietly, so as not to arouse
suspicion, and had found that without exception
the community regarded Lemuel as a sterling,
though simple, character, and held Dot in no less
high esteem than did Mrs. Liggs. About the only
weakness that the father had, was an inordinate
worship of education and educated people, which
found reflection in a consuming passion to provide
his daughter with those advantages that would
make her a woman of superior culture and refinement,
so the camp said. And this, to Lex’s
mind, was an unerring sign of probity in any
man, a native genteelness that could not go far
wrong.</p>

<p>One morning, two weeks after the Huntingtons
had left for San Francisco, Lex motored from
the ranch into Geerusalem. He had said nothing to
Coates and Tyler about what he now contemplated
doing, merely instructing them to await his return.
Once in camp, however, he had the constable send
a wire to the San Francisco chief of police requesting
him to locate if possible the hotel at
which Lemuel and Dot were registered. Around
six o’clock that afternoon a reply was received,
naming the Golden West.</p>

<p>Without loss of time, Lex sprang into his roadster
and drove to the railroad, where he caught the
night train for the North. After due reflection,
he had decided to have a quiet talk with Huntington
and his daughter, one in which the detectives would
have no part; for somehow he rather resented their
thinly veiled insinuations and coarse remarks toward
a man against whom they possessed not a vestige
of incriminating evidence. In fact, he was certain
he could get more from the Huntingtons through a
friendly discussion, than might be gained by the
intimidating, browbeating methods employed by inquisitors
of the Coates and Tyler type.</p>

<p>Besides, manlike, he was just a little bit curious
to meet this girl, Dot, of whom he had heard
such flattering reports, whose picture he had gazed
on so many times during his fortnight at the ranch,
who was so close to his dear little old friend,
Mrs. Liggs.</p>

<p>But in one particular, his plans miscarried, for
it so happened that while he was en route to San
Francisco, Lemuel—having sight-seen the metropolis
to his entire satisfaction, as well as gratified the
desire of his life by settling Dot in Longwell Seminary
for her first year—was on his way back to
Geerusalem, with a headful of progressive ideas
calculated to make him in the next decade, through
the early purchase of a herd of stock cattle, the
principal cowman of southern California. Their
trains passed each other in the night.</p>

<p>The following day when Lemuel reached home,
he was confronted by Coates and Tyler and learned
to his bewilderment and dismay that he was under
arrest for no less a crime than knowingly appropriating
to himself twenty thousand dollars belonging
to the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad
Company. They ordered him into the kitchen
and began grilling him—bombarding him with questions,
disputing his answers, tripping him up, now
and again hurling their accusations at him, cajoling
him in one breath, threatening him in the next.</p>

<p>Hour after hour, they kept it up untiringly,
mercilessly, and because he could not give a convincing
story of how he had known that Billy Gee
was hiding in the hayloft—fearing as he did to
mention even so much as his daughter’s name in
conjunction with the case—they decided to hold
him on the John Doe warrant they had procured
from the local judge, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>At dark, Coates mounted one of Lemuel’s horses
and rode into Geerusalem and communicated by
telephone with Sangerly, senior, Western manager
of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern in Los Angeles. He
gave a brief account of the failure which had
attended their search and ended with the declaration
that it was the professional opinion of himself and
Tyler that Lemuel Huntington was the thief. Stating
simply that Lex had gone to San Francisco,
Coates informed Mr. Sangerly that they desired
to remove their prisoner to the county jail for
further questioning and asked for official sanction
in the matter.</p>

<p>This being granted, he rushed the usual legal
formalities necessary to take a prisoner out of the
jurisdiction of the Geerusalem courts and sped
away for the ranch in a rented machine, his object
being to get Lemuel out of the district before Lex
returned; for now there was not the remotest doubt
in the mind of those two man-hunters that Dot’s
father was the sensational catch of their careers.</p>

<p>It was a bright, starry night, warm and quiet,
and it was nine o’clock, when the driver brought
the car to a halt before the Huntington ranch.
Coates sprang out and was presently pounding
on the front door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there? That you, Ray?” shouted Tyler
from inside.</p>

<p>“Yes. Open up! Everything’s jake. We’re on
our way.”</p>

<p>The next moment the door was thrown open and
Coates entered, gazing in amazement at his partner,
grim of face, six-shooter in hand. Back of him,
in the hall, stood Lemuel, his sunburned, leathery
cheeks yellow with alarm, his eyes bulging wildly.</p>

<p>“See anybody outside?” asked Tyler.</p>

<p>“Only the driver of the machine. What’s eating
you anyhow? You look like you been shot at and
missed.” He chuckled roughly.</p>

<p>“Yeh? Well, come on in the kitchen and I’ll show
you something’ll make your hair curl.” Turning
the key in the lock, Tyler led the way toward the
rear of the house. On the oil-cloth covered table lay
a soiled old envelope containing a lead-pencil
scribble. He picked it up and handed it to Coates,
who read:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I jest cum to take my saddle an bags an pack off the
    20,000 that you dicks aint bin able to find. After this
    better close the window so folks cant lissen. An dont show
    yore nose outside cos Im shootin tonite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coates stared at his colleague, the yellow lamplight
showing his face drawing into hard, cruel
lines. A furious curse burst from him. “Billy
Gee!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Yes, damn him!” growled Tyler. “Half an hour
ago I heard a knock out front. I thought it was
you coming back. That’s what I found shoved
under the door.” He indicated the envelope. “While
we were quizzing the old duffer, like a coupla rummies,
Billy was getting an earful at the window.
Kids us about it, you’ll notice.”</p>

<p>Coates’ withering eyes rested on the other. “He
beats it with the swag, you notice that, too, don’t
you? And you’ve stuck inside here, like a big
walrus, and let him. What the hell kind of a
free-lunch detective——”</p>

<p>“Say, soft-pedal that stuff, pal!” flared Tyler
menacingly. “I don’t see you busting no records—except
it’s slipping the bull. If you think I’m
tearing out after this wild and woolly yegg, so’s
he can pot-shot me first flop out of the box, you’re
cuckoo. Maybe I ought’ve taken the lamp and
looked under the rosebushes for him, eh?”</p>

<p>Coates made no reply. Raging silently he paced
the floor. Some seconds afterward he halted before
Tyler.</p>

<p>“This is certainly some swell mess. That’s all
I got to say. I phoned the chief, got his O. K.,
talked my head off to get the papers signed, and
rented a machine for the trip. For what? We’ve
put in two weeks in this hole for nothing. The
money’s gone. Get me? Gone! We might as well
sling onto our grips and report back to headquarters
for a damn fine panning. Hot dog!”</p>

<p>Tyler laughed. “Rave on! To hear you say it
I’m the whole show, ain’t I? I’m supposed to pull
a fancy moving-picture stunt, while you stand on
the side lines rooting for me. Pretty soft! Sure,
I get you! You’re trying to slip out from under—make
me the goat. Say, bo, any time you think——”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut it out! Let’s get out after this wise
bird, see if we can’t pick up his tracks. I got
the car outside. If we don’t get a line on him,
we’ll shoot to camp and phone the old man,” cut
in Coates surlily. He turned to Lemuel, standing
near the stove, rubbing his bony hands in hopeless
apprehension. “Mr. Huntington, we’re letting you
go on probation. But don’t leave the country till
we tell you, d’you understand? Take care of our
traps for a few days. If we don’t come back
we’ll send for them. Come on, Tyler, we’ll——”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, interrupted by the furious
honking of the horn of the machine waiting out
on the road, the thunderous roar of its open muffler.</p>

<p>With Tyler at his heels he dashed for the front
door. Clearing the porch in one bound they sped
down the garden walk, gripping their revolvers,
straining their eyes toward the car, looming black
against the sky horizon of the plains.</p>

<p>“I’m cutting for the field. Watch your shots!”
panted Coates in low tones, swinging off on a
tangent through the garden.</p>

<p>But he had barely cleared the walk when the automobile
suddenly leaped away; and simultaneously
its headlights flashed on, boring twin avenues of
white flame through the darkness in the direction
of distant Mirage. Alongside the driver, the silhouette
of a man was now visible. He megaphoned
back with his hands at the two detectives:</p>

<p>“Thanks for the machine, fellers. Noo York
service I call it. Give my reegards to old Law an’
Order.”</p>

<p>Coates and Tyler emptied their six-shooters wildly
at the car. Cursing frantically, they sprang in
pursuit, loading and firing their weapons as they
ran. But the machine, speeding on like the wind,
whirled out of range and went on and on, plunging
and careening over the uneven road, vanished into
the vastness of the desert night.</p>

<p>“That squares us. You had your fling at him,”
said Tyler to Coates.</p>

<h2 title='XII—Reputations at Stake' id='chXII'>
  CHAPTER XII—REPUTATIONS AT STAKE
</h2>

<p>Dot Huntington, though fascinated with
Longwell Seminary on the one hand, scorned
it on the other. As an institution of learning she
believed it quite perfect, all that could be desired;
but she resented its strict discipline, those rigid
rules which deprived her of certain privileges which
she had, with parental consent, enjoyed all her life,
chiefly, the right to come and go unchaperoned
whenever she wished and to read any book that
pleased her fancy.</p>

<p>However, a sudden overwhelming appetite for
education seized her, and this very readily reconciled
her to the loss of her personal liberty, for while
she inherited none of her father’s passion for
culture, her ambition and pride were such as to
impel her to set for her goal those high honors
for which the seminary was noted. So, brought
face to face with tomes of fact and instruction,
she threw herself whole-heartedly into the task of
mastering them in order to attain that grade of
erudition which her age and matureness of mind
made necessary. In order to bring this last about,
Lemuel had made special arrangements that she
take instructions from a private teacher in order
that she might go more rapidly forward.</p>

<p>Again, displeased as she was with the institution’s
system of discipline, she was deeply interested in
its student body. She had never known the companionship
of girls of her age before, and here
there were scores of them, and not a few daughters
of the most prominent families of the West. Having
a prepossessing personality that attracted people
to her, she made friends; and these vivacious newfound
companions, added to the fascination with
which her studies gripped her, contributed greatly
in causing her to put aside that one haunting
worry that had periodically harrassed her ever since
she left Geerusalem, for she was still the unwilling
custodian of the white-elephant fortune in bills.
Mrs. Liggs had not arrived, nor had she answered
Lemuel’s telegram for that matter. Dot could not
imagine what had happened to their little old
friend, on whom she depended to solve the problem
for her.</p>

<p>Three days after Lemuel had wired Mrs. Liggs,
asking her to come to San Francisco, they had
given up hope of hearing from her. Considerably
mystified, they had been finally driven into visiting
the manager of one of the big stores and confessing
that Dot was going to attend a select seminary
and needed a complete wardrobe. As a result,
Dot was now the proud possessor of as dainty
and chic a collection of gowns, expensive lingerie,
hats and shoes, as had been displayed in Longwell’s
in more than a decade.</p>

<p>However, Mrs. Liggs’ strange absence and silence
remained a mystery; and, as a consequence, the
twenty thousand dollars remained wrapped in the
old silk shawl in Dot’s room, which she shared
with the daughter of a shipbuilder of Portland,
Oregon. Yet, let it not be assumed that Dot was
for one moment unmindful of the ultimate disposition
of this money. On the contrary, she was
determined that it should eventually find its way
back to its rightful owners. The thing is, that
her first nervousness had left her. Constant reflection
on a subject of fearful moment in due time
robs that subject of its alarms.</p>

<p>She now calmly reasoned that since Mrs. Liggs
had failed her she would simply abide the coming
of that hour when she could get up sufficient
courage to write to the Mohave &amp; Southwestern
Railroad Company, telling them she had Billy Gee’s
loot and explaining the entire situation in such a
way as to protect herself from the possibility of
subsequent newspaper notoriety. This, she made
up her mind to do; and then suddenly, a day or
two after, she remembered with a thrill of joy, Bob
Warburton, her father’s friend. Why had she
not thought of Warburton before? He was the
very man who could and would return this ill-gotten
treasure to its owners and in all probability even
go so far as to withhold her name in the case.</p>

<p>It was late one afternoon when the happy thought
struck her. She was in her room and she immediately
sat down and wrote out a telegram to
Warburton, asking him to come to San Francisco at
once, as she had something of the utmost importance
to tell him.</p>

<p>Then she ran downstairs and stole away across
the garden to a secluded arbor in the far corner
of the seminary grounds. On a small ledge beneath
one of the old rustic benches, among a mass of
other clandestine correspondence, she placed the
message and the money for the coachman—a sympathetic
individual who, because of the handsome
tips he enjoyed from his precluded side line, was
a stanch advocate of drastic academic rules against
letter writing.</p>

<p>Dot, having taken the first definite step to rid
herself of the responsibility which had weighed her
down since the morning she had opened her bureau
drawer and discovered the prodigality of Billy Gee’s
gratitude, hurried back through the garden. As
she reached a point where she could command a
view of the walk leading from the street to the
seminary’s front door, she came to an abrupt halt.
Slowly approaching along the walk came a familiar
figure, that of a little old woman, dressed in a neat,
correct street dress. One glance, and the girl
gave a glad cry. It was Mrs. Liggs! Shrilling
her name, Dot raced toward her.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Liggs! Mrs. Liggs! Where have you
been? We waited so long. We didn’t know
what—— You darling!” she cried. She caught
the frail form in her strong young arms and hugged
and kissed her until the pale-blue eyes glistened
with joy.</p>

<p>Locked in each other’s arms they stood on the
seminary’s steps for some minutes talking in a
fury of happy excitement. It developed that Mrs.
Liggs had come to the city a few days after she
had received Lemuel’s telegram. She had not been
able to meet them as she had intended because of
a sudden change of plans, which had required her
presence in the southern part of the State prior
to journeying north. Inquiry at the Golden West
Hotel on her arrival elicited the information that
Dot’s trunks had been checked out to Longwell’s
Seminary, but Mrs. Liggs had postponed her visit
until she got settled in a quiet place, away from
the nerve-racking noise of the city’s business district.
She told the girl all this in a hesitant,
wistful voice, much as if she were relating something
that was not entirely to her liking.</p>

<p>Presently, Dot led the way inside and thence
into one of the gloomy parlors, grim in its austere
furnishings, high ceiling and scrupulous cleanliness.
On one of the walls, in a plain black mahogany
frame, the stern visage of one of the Longwell
sisters glared icily down on them. Authorization
to conduct the Longwell Seminary as an educational
institution was strikingly displayed in a gold-bordered
parchment, bearing the seal of the State
of California, and a hundred words of beautiful
handwriting painfully difficult to decipher under
the most favorable conditions.</p>

<p>As they were about to seat themselves a maid
attired in severe black made her noiseless appearance
at the door and, with a cautious glance over
her shoulder, motioned hurriedly to Dot.</p>

<p>“Something terrible has happened, Miss Huntington,”
she whispered, when the girl joined her in
the hall. “Miss Jessie Longwell phoned the trustees,
and they’re holding a meeting in the office now,
about——” She broke off, her eyes seeking the
floor.</p>

<p>“Go on, Mary! They’re holding a meeting, you
say, and it’s over me, isn’t it?” said Dot quietly.</p>

<p>The maid nodded. “They’re trying to decide
whether to expel you or not.”</p>

<p>“Expel me? Why—why, you surely must be
mistaken. I can’t imagine——”</p>

<p>“It’s something that’s in the afternoon papers.
I haven’t been able to see it. I heard them talking
about it. Miss Longwell’s taken all of them and
given strict orders for us not to allow any more
in the seminary until further notice from her.”</p>

<p>Bewilderment, then anxiety struggled in Dot’s
face. Her thoughts flashed to her father.</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Mary? Did you hear what it
was over? Was anything said?” she asked, trusting
herself to speak finally.</p>

<p>“I only heard them mention your name, Miss
Huntington, and—and something about disgrace,”
said the maid. “I tried to catch what they accused
you of, but Miss Longwell closed the door. I’m
so sorry—if there’s any trouble.”</p>

<p>Dot thanked her and went back to Mrs. Liggs.
The old lady studied her narrowly as she resumed
her seat.</p>

<p>“It’s bad news, ain’t it, Dot? I can see it in
your face, so don’t story to me, deary. And it’s
about your father and—and Billy Gee, ain’t it?”
She drew up her chair as she spoke, and took the
girl’s hand affectionately in her own.</p>

<p>Dot told her what the maid had said, and Mrs.
Liggs nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what it is—an account of Billy
Gee and your dad, sweetheart,” she said. “The
papers are full of it, and that’s why I come to-day
to see you. I wanted you to know the truth.”</p>

<p>“But—but what has happened?” cried Dot, pale
and starting to tremble.</p>

<p>“Nothing, honey, and that’s the worst of it. If
it was true I wouldn’t care, ’cos it couldn’t be
helped. It’s just a whole lot of rot that them
reporters glory to write about.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, she gave the girl the details of a
sensational first-page story telling of Billy Gee’s
sudden reappearance at the Huntington ranch, after
the authorities of San Buenaventura County had
conclusively stated that he had perished on the
desert following his escape from Warburton; how
he had made away in the railroad detective’s automobile,
and an account of Lemuel’s arrest on suspicion
of having appropriated the stolen funds of
the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad Company, and
his subsequent release pending further investigation,
as a result of the note written by the outlaw
declaring that he had dug up and taken with him
the twenty-thousand-dollar cache.</p>

<p>Dot listened attentively throughout that simple
recital, an odd admiration she could not subdue
dancing in her eyes at this latest of Billy Gee’s
reckless exploits. Even while her little old friend
was speaking, she understood the reason for this
daring bandit’s action; her father had been suspected
of the theft, and Billy Gee had lied to save
him. Moreover, Billy Gee had lied to make wholly
secure his twenty-thousand-dollar gift to her! Her
heart beat fast; she could hear it pounding in her
ears. Billy Gee had not forgotten, was not forgetting
her. He was magnificent, romantically magnificent
in his outlawry.</p>

<p>“And no matter how I’ve hated your dad, Dot,
I know he never took that money,” resumed Mrs.
Liggs, after a short pause. “He’s honest and
wouldn’t do such a thing.”</p>

<p>“You’ve hated dad?” echoed the girl, staring incredulously
at the bowed gray head.</p>

<p>She thought there was something infinitely pathetic
in the appearance of that small figure before
her, the droop of its narrow shoulders, the forlornness
of its pose. This was not the sprightly, merry,
little storekeeper she had known these last three
years in far-off Geerusalem.</p>

<p>“I did, yes. But that’s all passed now. I’ve
been happy to forget—and forgive, Dot.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mother Liggs! I won’t believe it. You
and father have always been such good friends.”</p>

<p>The older woman nodded uncertainly at the carpet.
She did not answer at once. The faint flush of
excitement, which her cheeks had worn until now,
vanished. Her gentle face was white and drawn;
her lips were twitching.</p>

<p>“I’ve—I’ve come to tell you something, honey—not
because I want to, but because he asked me to.
I’m—I’m Billy Gee’s mother, Dot.” Her whisper,
broken, scarcely audible, penetrated to the farthest
recess of that cold, silent room.</p>

<p>She turned brimming eyes to the girl now, and
there was an appeal in them that could not be
misunderstood—a dumb, fearful eagerness, a hungry
waiting for a word, a touch, a smile; a look like
that of some wretched penitent craving mercy. A
painful, tragic pause ensued.</p>

<p>“You’re <i>his</i> mother?” repeated Dot slowly at last.
She gazed almost in ludicrous unbelief at the
withered, wistful, old countenance raised to hers.
Then suddenly an ineffable tenderness suffused the
girl’s face, poured from her eyes. She fell on her
knees beside Mrs. Liggs and gathered her close in
her arms. “You’re a wonderful little mother, and
I love you better for being <i>his</i> mother—because I
know it,” she breathed, half sobbing, and kissed the
aged cheeks again and again, and fondled the thin,
tired hands against her bosom.</p>

<p>For the next quarter of an hour Mrs. Liggs
opened her heart, laid it bare of its secrets—for
the first time since the criminal career of her only
child, Jerome, had darkened the future for her and
filled her life with fears and heartaches. Weeping
softly, she told that tragic story, from that awful
morning in Marysville, three years before, when
the police came to the Liggs home searching for
Jerome—charged by City Treasurer Gene Miles with
embezzlement of city funds—up to the day of his
capture by Lemuel Huntington.</p>

<p>As any mother would, she tried to excuse her
wayward boy for everything he had subsequently
done in defiance of law, by pointing out that the
criminal authorities had hounded him, made him a
social outcast, thereby forcing him to pursue his
desperate calling as a means of living. Nor was
she wholly wrong in her accusation, as any ex-convict
will straightway affirm. A penitentiary
record—though Billy Gee had never known the interior
of a prison cell—is a full brother to guilt
forever after, in the eyes of the law’s bloodhounds.</p>

<p>Society seems to forget that the man who pays
the debt it imposes on him regains, by every moral
principle, his standing among the ranks of righteous
humankind. Instead, breaking faith with the very
justice it presumes to mete out, it claps the stigma
of ignominy on the wrongdoer and never removes
it; once a jailbird, always a jailbird, is the tenor
of its smug opinion, and being itself ruthless in
the exercise of its self-bestowed powers, it gives
to men of the Coates and Tyler type authority to
apprehend law-breakers. Incompetency and political
patronage rule the system of law enforcement, making
it a stupid, clumsy institution whose methods
of operation serve rather to increase than decrease
the commission of crime.</p>

<p>Mrs. Liggs was still speaking when a sharp
rap sounded on the parlor door. It was the maid,
coming to inform Dot that Miss Jessie Longwell,
president of the seminary, wished to speak with
her in the office. The girl thought for a moment;
then, insisting that her little old friend accompany
her, she escorted Mrs. Liggs out of the room and
down the spacious hall to another apartment, fitted
with correct businesslike furnishings, including a
large flat-top oak desk before which sat the head
of the school.</p>

<p>Miss Longwell was, at a glance, a most unattractive
specimen of middle-aged person, haughty,
self-contained, precision itself, and thin as a lath.
She sat rigid as a steel spring in her straight-back
chair, and let her stony, gimlet eyes back of their
immense shell-rimmed glasses, rest icily on Dot;
then she focused them inquiringly on Mrs. Liggs.</p>

<p>“Miss Huntington,” she began, in a quick, crisp
voice, “I said, I believe, that I wished to speak with
you privately.”</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Liggs, Miss Longwell, a very dear
friend of mine,” returned Dot, by way of explanation,
at the same time going through the formalities
of introduction. “Whatever must be said may be
done so in her presence. I think I know the nature
of the interview,” she added.</p>

<p>Miss Longwell’s lips tightened, then she got up
very decidedly and closed the door. On her way
back to her desk she halted before Dot.</p>

<p>“I regret very much, Miss Huntington,” she said,
speaking in slow impressive tones, “that an unfortunate
condition has arisen which makes it quite
impossible for you to continue as a student of
Longwell Seminary. Indeed, it distresses me greatly
to have to make this fact known to you. Your
conduct has been most exemplary in the short time
you have been here, and as to your application and
progress in the several lines of study you have
taken up, you have exceeded our fullest expectations.
But——”</p>

<p>“What is this condition you just mentioned, Miss
Longwell?” broke in Dot.</p>

<p>“Why—er—it concerns your father. Now, while
I have not the slightest doubt that the—er—thing
is simply a newspaper canard, still the long-standing
reputation of Longwell’s Seminary as an institution
of high ideals cannot be placed in jeopardy under
any circumstances. Why, your father, Miss Huntington,
I am very grieved to state is accused of
possible complicity in a—in a theft.”</p>

<p>Dot flushed angrily. The manner of the speaker
as she pronounced the word was insulting, she
thought.</p>

<p>“But you have met my father, Miss Longwell. Do
you absolutely think he’s that kind of man?” she
asked quietly.</p>

<p>“To be frank with you, I don’t. Still, as you
must certainly realize, that does not alter the case.
The mere accusation is so serious as to cause unfavorable
comment, if not cast discredit on this
institution, did we allow you to remain a member
of our student body. This was the unanimous verdict
of our board of trustees at a meeting which
just now adjourned. Acting under its instruction,
I am wiring your father. You will get your effects
together, preparatory to leaving. I would add that
I am extremely sorry, Miss Huntington——”</p>

<p>“I’m not!” interrupted Dot suddenly. She drew
her slim figure up with queenly defiance, her eyes
glittering dangerously. “And what is more, Miss
Longwell, I do not want your sympathy. I am
glad that I have at least found out just how really
elevating a school of this kind is. You pride
yourselves on building up character. You help
ruin reputations as readily, I notice. By sending
me home, you advertise to the world that Lemuel
Huntington is a thief, that I, his daughter, am the
child of a thief—a person too low to attend so
pure and undefiled an institution as——”</p>

<p>“Oh, deary, you mustn’t say such awful things!”
burst out Mrs. Liggs nervously.</p>

<p>“Miss Huntington, the interview is over,” snapped
the preceptress, a flush mantling her prominent high
cheek bones. “You will retire to your room, where
you will await my orders.”</p>

<p>“Your orders?” cried Dot. “Madam, I’m serving
notice on you that I’m leaving your spotless institution
just as soon as I can pack my belongings!
And you will please return me the balance of my
tuition fee before I go.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly she allowed pacifying little Mrs. Liggs
to lead her from the room and back into the parlor.
Burning with shame and indignation, she paced the
floor for some minutes, while the older woman
talked, counseling her against the reënactment of the
scene in the office when she applied to Miss Longwell
for her money. Presently, they had arranged
it between them that Dot was to stop with her
friend until word could be got to Lemuel. Within
the hour, they were descending the front steps,
the tuition fee in Dot’s purse, the sympathetic
maid instructed to send the girl’s baggage to Mrs.
Liggs’ home.</p>

<p>As they took their seats in a taxi, and Dot kissed
sprightly fingers at Longwell’s Seminary, another
machine came to a stop on the opposite side of the
street. The lone passenger, on the point of getting
out, stopped and stared after the other cab now
whirling rapidly away. It was Lex Sangerly. He
had been told at the Golden West Hotel that Lemuel
had departed for Geerusalem, after presumably having
entered his daughter in Longwell Seminary.
Whereupon, Lex had decided to visit the girl, introduce
himself through the medium of Mrs. Liggs’
friendship, and question her in the hope that she
might throw some light on the mysterious disappearance
of the contents of Billy Gee’s saddlebags.</p>

<p>From this it may be deduced that Lex had not
read the sensational newspaper story that day, incriminating
Lemuel Huntington in the affair. Just
now, he gazed in growing amazement at the taxi
speeding down the street.</p>

<p>“By George! If that isn’t Mrs. Liggs, I’ll——”
he burst out and ended by shouting hurried instructions
to the chauffeur. The next moment he had
started in pursuit of the cab.</p>

  CHAPTER XIII—SINISTER FOREBODINGS
</h2>

<p>Mrs. Agatha Liggs occupied a neat cozy four-room
cottage in the residential section of San
Francisco, known as Richmond District. A well-kept
garden, colorful with blossoming plants, flanked
and fronted it; and there was a Cherokee rose which
spread its wild luxuriant arms across the length of
the porch and festooned it thick with its pink,
floppy flowers during the early spring. Six blocks
away, across a field of lupins, the waves of the
blue Pacific lapped a narrow stretch of beach under
the shadow of crumbling shale cliffs. The Presidio
fortifications loomed here and there along the
heights, frowning, formidable piles of concrete out
of which peeped the grim noses of long-range guns
turned seaward, reminding one of dogs of war everlastingly
on the alert for the first scent of danger.</p>

<p>It was a mile or more from the Longwell Seminary
to Mrs. Liggs’ home, and on the way there,
Billy Gee’s mother found time to finish telling
Dot her story, which the maid had interrupted when
she came to summon the girl before the preceptress.
This had to do principally with the fact that the
bandit, after his escape, had written her a letter
which she had received the same day Lemuel’s
telegram reached her. He told her where he was
in hiding and, following a night of harrowing
thought—fearful that he might risk a trip to Geerusalem
to see her, and be captured—she had decided
to dispose of her dry-goods store and move away
from Soapweed Plains. Learning that Dot was to
enter school in San Francisco, and having no definite
plans as to where to establish her residence, she
had chosen the metropolis, happy in the knowledge,
she said, that she would be near her friend whom
she would see often, besides feeling certain that her
outlaw son could make his home with her, secure
in the crowded confines of a great city, and abandon
forever his lawless calling.</p>

<p>Selling her store, she had boarded a train and
gone south with Tinnemaha Pete, and under the
guidance of the old desert prospector, had found
Billy Gee’s hiding place—a lonely desert cave, in
a lonelier cañon of the Calico Range. But the outlaw
was absent, and though they waited several
days for him, until the provisions they had brought
along were gone, he did not return. At last, filled
with misgivings, she had come away at the instance
of Tinnemaha Pete who, after accompanying her
to the nearest settlement, went back to acquaint her
son with her plans when he came. Arriving in the
city, she had rented the cottage and written Billy
Gee, giving her new address, and had received a
long letter from him the day before.</p>

<p>“And it’s the blessedest letter I ever got from
him, Dot,” she concluded, her old eyes swimming.
“I think he’s—I think he’s quit the awful life.
I’m praying God every, every night, to give him
strength.”</p>

<p>Dot made no reply. Her arm stole around the
other, and she gazed ahead, an odd light in her eyes.</p>

<p>The taxi drew up to the cottage, and they got
out. Mrs. Liggs led the way along the narrow
walk, pausing every few steps to point out to the
girl the glories of the garden. As they were about
to go in the house, Lex Sangerly’s machine arrived.
He came bounding through the gate, shouting out
a merry greeting to Mrs. Liggs.</p>

<p>“You should know better than try to sneak away
from me, Mother Liggs,” he cried, as he halted
before her, wringing her hands and laughing at
her bewilderment. “That was a shameless way to
treat a fellow—not even tell him you were selling
out. I absolutely demand an apology—and a
pumpkin pie. I followed you all the way from
the seminary.”</p>

<p>“Goodness me, Lex, what in the world——&#160;It
was all so sudden, Lex, that I——” she began,
with a tremulous pathetic smile. “You’ve got to
forgive me. Sometimes things don’t go just right
for folks, and they act without thinking. This is
Mr. Sangerly, Dot. And you’ve heard me speak
of Miss Huntington, Lex.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes,” he smiled pleasantly. “Mrs. Liggs
has said some very flattering things about you,
Miss Huntington. I am always delighted to meet a
good friend of hers.”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Liggs briefly explained to Dot that the
Sangerlys had once been neighbors of hers in San
José and gave a number of humorous instances to
prove Lex’s shocking capacity for pumpkin pie.
Laughing, they entered the cottage and, while the
visitor waited in the parlor, the women went
through the prosaic process of removing their street
clothes and donning house dresses. A little later,
Mrs. Liggs bustled off for the kitchen—for they
must have a cup of her favorite tea, she merrily
announced—and Dot joined Lex.</p>

<p>They sat opposite each other and, as they talked,
the man admitted to himself that this girl, inhabitant
of the desert though she was, surpassed in
many respects the young women with whom he was
acquainted in such cultured California centers as
Pasadena and Burlingame. There was a native refinement
about her, a charming grace of movement—little
subtle characteristics of elegance—that
caused him to marvel and to conclude that she must
have inherited them from her mother, since her
father certainly lacked them. But what particularly
impressed him was the fresh, striking beauty of
her, the spirit and frankness and deep strain of
sympathy in her face, and that elusive something
that marked her at a glance a daughter of the
waste lands.</p>

<p>They talked on. Yes, he had heard she was
attending Longwell Seminary, and she had been
informed that his father was Western manager
of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Railroad. They
both liked Geerusalem. She told him a number
of things about herself, chiefly how she loved to
read and how greatly she wanted to write stories—gripping
stories of adventure. He sat and listened
to her and confidentially affirmed to himself that
here was a girl who would have fitted into his
life as perhaps no other would—not even his petite,
brown-eyed fiancée, daughter of the steamship company’s
president whose guest he was during his
stay in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Doubtless it was this strong appeal which Dot’s
personality had for him that made it quite impossible
for him to explain his mission to her. He
shied at opening the subject, and as for deliberately
cross-examining her, he felt that it was out of the
question. She was too obviously not the type of
girl to have anything to do with an illegal act
of any kind; of that he was assured. Rather, he
believed, she was the sort who would have reported
to Warburton at the time whatever suspicions she
might have had regarding Billy Gee’s movements.
However, he presently contrived to turn the conversation
to the outlaw’s escape and he noted a
new interest flash up in her eyes, as he did so.
It puzzled him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, I’m biased, Miss Huntington, because
of my association with the M. &amp; S., but nothing
would make me happier than to hear that he was
lodged in a San Quentin dungeon for life, or shot
down by a posse,” he replied slowly, in answer to
her questions as to his opinion of the outlaw’s
exploits. “Rather brutal, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Altogether brutal, Mr. Sangerly,” she said
frankly. “But then, I’m also biased. You see, I
owe him considerable, in a way, and won’t allow
myself to forget it.” She paused, meeting his eyes.
“If my father had not captured him and gotten the
reward, I wouldn’t be in San Francisco to-day,
with the opportunity of an education before me—the
chance of seeing something outside of Soapweed
Plains and Geerusalem all my life. I am candid
in telling you this. It’s true.” Her expression
changed. “Sometimes the thought sickens me. It’s
like blood money.”</p>

<p>He broke into a hearty laugh. “Nonsense, Miss
Huntington! Why, if we were to stop and consider
the history of the dollar—the grief, misery, degradation,
filth that each almighty dollar has been the
means of creating—we’d be too nauseated to look
at it, to say nothing of buying our daily bread with
it and dropping it in the collection plates!”</p>

<p>“There may be a lot in that, but in my case the
evidence is right before me—staring me out of
countenance. To me, it’s just like selling a soul.
And because I feel that way about it, I know I’m
deeply indebted to Billy Gee——”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” cried Lex. “He’s a law-breaker—a
dangerous desperado. He robs men, seizes other
men’s belongings, appropriates to himself what isn’t
his, threatens men’s lives to do it. Miss Huntington,
anybody who captures such an animal, who rids
the world of such an animal, deserves far more
than your father received from the M. &amp; S.” He
had spoken brusquely, animated by a conscientious
detestation of crime and criminals in any form.
She was watching him, studying him curiously.
“The only regret I have,” he added, “is that he had
to die. I would rather see such a man wearing out
his soul in prison.”</p>

<p>“He’s dead, did you say? Why, father wrote me
that Mr. Warburton was of the opinion that——”
A faint smile hovered about her lips, a tantalizing
smile.</p>

<p>“Bob Warburton is a person of foresight; usually
he knows what he’s talking about. But in this
case——&#160;Why, if Billy Gee were alive, Miss
Huntington, we would have heard from him long
ago. He was one of those ugly customers who
have a mania for seeing their names in print. Isn’t
it significant that our trains have not been robbed—not
even molested—since the day of his capture?
Billy Gee was a bred-in-the-bone crook, Miss Huntington,
the type that never reforms. He perished
on the desert, and I’m saying that with all due
respect to the opinion of our good friend, Warburton.”</p>

<p>Dot did not reply. Her mind went back to the
night she had parted with Billy Gee in the dark
hayloft, the moon shining through the hole under
the eaves, showing him standing knee-deep in the
loose hay, reflecting on the bloody bandage around
his head. She heard his voice again, saying:</p>

<p>“You’re goin’ to hear from me, Miss Huntington—some
time. An’—an’ I hope you’ll be proud,
like you jest said.” It was the sound of his voice,
the way he had spoken those words, that remained
ever vivid in her memory. To-day, she had met the
mother of Billy Gee!</p>

<p>At this juncture Mrs. Liggs entered the parlor
to announce that luncheon was ready. They seated
themselves at the table in the cool little dining
room, and their hostess poured the tea and led the
conversation, which ran the gamut from reminiscences
of bygone days in San José to a series of
interesting episodes in and around Geerusalem. But
she steered carefully clear of any mention of lawlessness,
being fearful of bringing the name of
her bandit son into the discussion and hearing
Lex’s criticism of him—the chum he believed dead.</p>

<p>“You men folks think us women don’t know
anything about business,” she laughed gayly. “But
there’s some of us do, Lex, and I’m one of them.
Of course, you’ll say that when it comes to selling
overalls and socks and cotton shirts I’m fine, but
that I ain’t got any idea about big business—real
big business. Now, won’t you?”</p>

<p>The talk had turned to a speculation of Geerusalem’s
future, Lex taking issue with Mrs. Ligg’s
statement that as a gold-producer it would surpass
both the Nevada camps of Goldfield and Tonopah.</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t say that, Mother Liggs,” he
replied. “Honestly, I believe you have keen foresight.
I’d rather take your opinion than that of
many mining engineers I know. But it really seems
an exaggeration to say that——”</p>

<p>“I’m agreeing with you, Mother Liggs,” broke in
Dot enthusiastically, and added in serious tones:
“Geerusalem, Mr. Sangerly, is only in its infancy,
as you know, and yet, look at its mines! They’re
enormously rich, and new prospects are being uncovered
right along. The only thing that’s keeping
it back is the unscrupulous type of men that have
control—rule it. Have you heard of the terrible
power they wield—the awful acts they commit?”</p>

<p>Lex nodded, his mind going back to his encounter
with Boss Quintell that evening before Mrs. Liggs’
dry-goods store, the scene in the street when Quintell’s
henchmen rallied, surrounded him, glowering
and menacing, at the sound of their master’s voice.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest doubt but that Geerusalem
has a flattering future,” he admitted presently. “As
a matter of truth, it is so certain of being a permanent
camp that the M. &amp; S. is about to begin
surveying for a spur track into it, from the Mirage
station. That goes to prove the company’s confidence
in it. And I may say, Miss Huntington,
that your father’s ranch, from what I’m able to
learn, is quite likely to be on the right of way.”</p>

<p>A glad cry broke from Dot. “Oh, won’t that be
wonderful! Just imagine, Mother Liggs, sitting on
the front porch, watching the trains go by!”</p>

<p>“In my opinion, it will increase the value of the
property to an appreciable degree,” said Lex. “I’ve
been wondering why your father hasn’t gone in
for cattle raising——”</p>

<p>He ceased speaking. An audible little gasp had
escaped Mrs. Liggs. He looked at her and saw
that her pale-blue eyes were fixed on him, wide
with excitement and dismay.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” she burst out. “It just come to
me who told me about that branch line, Lex. There’s
a scheme on to stop it. They’re going to keep
it out of Geerusalem if they got to kill and murder
to do it.”</p>

<p>A short silence fell. Lex regarded her curiously
a moment before he spoke.</p>

<p>“I think you must be mistaken, Mother Liggs,”
he said finally. “I don’t think any one would oppose
a spur into Geerusalem. It would help make the
camp. Who do you mean by <i>they</i>?”</p>

<p>“Jule Quintell and his crowd. Listen! About a
month ago, George Harrison—he’s Quintell’s private
secretary—came into my store to buy something.
I’ve known him ever since he arrived in camp; that’s
about two years. He’d been drinking this afternoon.
We got talking, and I asked him if there
was anything new—sociablelike, you know. And
he said they’d been tipped off that a railroad company
was figuring on building a track into camp
from the main line.</p>

<p>“I told him I thought it’d be just the thing we
needed. He laughed—oh, so nasty!—and leaned
over the counter and said: ‘Mrs. Liggs, railroads
generally get their own way, but they won’t in this
neck of the woods. We’re going to draw a line
in the sand and tell them they’ll go that far and
no further.’ ‘You sure ain’t going to stop them,
Mr. Harrison?’ I asked. ‘We’re going to make
them come to us. And if they try their strong-arm
tactics we’ll give them all they’re looking for. If
it’s a case of fight we’ll make Soapweed Plains
look like a slaughterhouse.’ I seen that he’d been
drinking considerable and I figured he might he
bragging, and I never thought nothing more about
it till just now when you mentioned the spur track.”</p>

<p>Lex lit a cigarette and gave her a smile. “I
think you’ll find he was doing that very thing,
Mother Liggs—bragging. Admitting that this fellow
Quintell is a power in Geerusalem and that
his word is law—why, if he so much as voiced an
objection to so important a factor to the camp’s
progress, as a railroad, his most trusted followers
would turn against him. Men nowadays appreciate
the value of transportation facilities. They
may buck the railroad companies on every issue
and all that sort of thing, but they can’t get along
without trains and they know it. Quintell wouldn’t
dare put a single, solitary obstacle in the way of
a spur track. On the contrary, he’ll peel off his
coat and help us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be too sure about that,” said Mrs.
Liggs, with a warning shake of her head. “You
don’t know him, Lex. Old Nick ain’t any trickier
than he is, and when it comes to being real dirty
and cruel and murderous, he’s worse than the
devil and all his fiends. He just plays with men—like
a cat does with a mouse. Any man that
crosses him is as good as gone. If Quintell can’t
crush him to the wall, ruin him, run him out of
camp, he has his throat cut; the buzzards finish
him. And it’s all done quietly. There’s no proof
or nothing. And all the time it’s getting stronger
and stronger, the Quintell machine is working day
and night, growing bolder, reaching out here and
there and grabbing mining property, deliberately
stealing it. I’ve heard that a lot of good men have
been forced to join the gangsters, ’cos they’re afraid
if they don’t stand in, they’ll lose their mines—if
they don’t turn up missing themselves, some
morning.”</p>

<p>Lex gave a short laugh. “I remember you warned
me that evening I met him in front of your store,”
he said easily; “and I’m going to repeat what I
told you. It’s this: He’ll meet the wrong man—at
the right time, Mother Liggs. But tell me, his
power lies in the slum element of the camp only,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You see that!” she cried triumphantly. “You
ain’t got the least idea how he works, how cunning
he is. No, it doesn’t! There’s mining engineers,
brokers, and assayers—influential rascals—in his
clique. They’re the brains of the gang. The slum
element, as you call it, are just the tools and they
do what they’re told—all the claim-jumping and
fighting and killing. Quintell, as anybody’ll tell
you, is the boss. They control the constable and
the courts, and no matter what one of the gang
does, he ain’t even arrested. I tell you, Lex, he’s
dangerous, as deadly as sin. He’s always put me
in mind of a big, horrible, poisonous spider that
gets fat killing little bugs and eating them.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one satisfaction, Mother Liggs,” he
replied, as he reached over and patted her hand:
“The career of a bad man is usually short. He’s
like a mosquito—he stings one time too many.
There was Billy Gee, for example. Never was there
a more contemptible scoundrel ever lived than that
miserable renegade——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me for interrupting you, Mr. Sangerly,
but are you in the mood for a surprise?”</p>

<p>It was Dot who spoke. While Mrs. Liggs and
Lex were talking she had quietly left the table and
gone into the bedroom. She stood now just inside
the door, her face sightly flushed, her eyes shining
with an odd light. In her hand, she held the
loot of the M. &amp; S., wrapped in her mother’s old
silk shawl. Mrs. Liggs, her snowy head resting on
her hand, gazed listlessly into her plate.</p>

<p>“A surprise is always in order, Miss Huntington,”
laughed Lex. “Providing, of course, it is a pleasant
one.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to leave you to judge whether this
one is or not,” said Dot.</p>

<p>She went over to his side of the table, cleared
away the dishes, and placed the neatly-bound sheaf
of bills before him.</p>

<p>A dramatic silence fell. He looked, then stared in
blank astonishment at the green and yellow pile
for a long moment. Dot was watching him with
dancing eyes. As for Mrs. Liggs, her face was a
study in stark bewilderment.</p>

<p>“What—what’s this? You can’t really mean—is
it possible, Miss Huntington, that——” stammered
Lex, and stopped.</p>

<p>“Dot, darling!” burst like a sob from Mrs. Liggs’
parted lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Sangerly, those are the actual bills—the
exact amount—that your company lost, twenty
thousand dollars,” said Dot in clear, ringing tones.
“I am returning it to you for Billy Gee. I have
one request to make, and that is that you exonerate
my father from the ridiculous charge your detectives
have placed against him. If there has been
an accomplice in this matter it is I.” She paused,
then resumed with a smile: “I’ll relate the facts
to you and let you decide for yourself. First, however,
in order that you may not labor under a
misapprehension—Billy Gee is alive.”</p>

  CHAPTER XIV—AN EPISODE IN THE HILLS
</h2>

<p>It seldom happens that a sheriff, or any peace officer
for that matter, ever regains the confidence
of the public, much less his popularity, once he
loses a prisoner of such supposed badness as was
Billy Gee. Somehow, it is difficult for the voters
to believe that a really efficient official may be
caught unawares and outwitted by a criminal, particularly
if that criminal is unarmed and handcuffed
into the bargain. So the conscientious
wielder of the franchise goes to the polls, and on
the strength of his theory that a sworn servant
of the people should be invincible and superior
to mistake and oversight, very gravely ousts the
incumbent candidate in favor of the untried timber
on the ballot.</p>

<p>The voters of San Buenaventura County, California,
were of another sort, however. Sheriff Bob
Warburton had proved up to their ideals for two
terms—even if he hadn’t been able to hold onto the
will-o’-the-wisp bandit of the Mohave. He was
sincere, always on the job, a good fellow, dependable.
That he had slipped once, should not condemn
him, asserted the electorate. What man does
not slip once?</p>

<p>Regardless of the fact, then, that Warburton had
resigned his office and that his political enemies
made a great to-do about the Billy Gee incident,
the people went to the polls strong for Warburton
and reinstated him to office by an avalanche vote.
And, as if to confirm their trust in him, on the
very day that he resumed his gold star he issued
a statement to the newspapers in which he vowed
to capture Billy Gee and get him the maximum
sentence under the law—imprisonment for life.</p>

<p>It was a week after election. During that week
Warburton received Dot’s telegram requesting him
to come to San Francisco. On the day following
its receipt, while he debated whether he should
make the trip or wire her for particulars, he got
an unexpected message from Lex Sangerly, stating
in so many words that the M. &amp; S. money had been
recovered and urging that information be kept secret
for the time being.</p>

<p>Warburton puzzled over the matter for hours. He
began to ask himself if it were not just possible that
there existed a clandestine love affair between Dot
and Billy Gee. Because of his intimate knowledge
of Lex’s movements in the case, Warburton was
certain that Sangerly had gone to San Francisco to
interview the girl and had found her in possession
of the outlaw’s loot. This, he reasoned, would explain
her telegram that she had something of importance
to tell him. Love alone could have moved
Billy Gee to part with twenty thousand dollars, was
the sheriff’s firm conviction.</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t be the first good woman fell for a
scalawag,” he muttered grimly, as he holstered his
six-shooters and picked up his rifle.</p>

<p>It was at that season of the year when the
desert region of southern California was beginning
to feel the atmospheric influences caused by the
early sprinkle of rain descending on the timbered
highlands to the north—the violent gustiness of the
wind whipping the sand into great clouds, the
strange sultriness of the nights, the blood-red sunsets.</p>

<p>Unknown to any member of his office, except his
second in command, Undersheriff Hodgson, Warburton
stole out of the county seat one evening on
a still hunt of weeks, and there was in his heart
the kind of determination that stops at nothing to
achieve its purpose.</p>

<p>Aside from his desire to merit the faith of the
people, there was a personal angle which made
his meeting with the bandit a thing of vital moment.
Any one familiar with the man-hunting
game will tell you that if there is one thing an
officer of the law never forgets, it is a bodily
injury received at the hands of a prisoner; also,
that he never quite forgives himself for losing a
prisoner. Either is, loosely speaking, a professional
disgrace, but it is more than that. An officer appreciates
only too well that he is the custodian of
the law, that his voice is the voice of the commonwealth,
that his body is as sacred as it is possible
for a human body to be sacred. Sheriff
Warburton cherished this belief with pride. Had
Billy Gee held him up at the point of a gun and
stripped him of his valuables, the act would have
been more or less forgivable alongside of striking
the <i>sheriff</i> down, shackling the <i>sheriff</i> with the
<i>sheriff’s</i> handcuffs, and making his escape.</p>

<p>The memory of that hurt had burned itself into
Warburton’s brain like some corroding acid. It
permeated his being with the deadliness of a
vicious poison. His determination to capture Billy
Gee came to be a mania with him, a mania similar
in intensity to that which had gripped Lemuel
Huntington to see Dot educated before he died.</p>

<p>To-day, Sheriff Warburton was out to “get”
Billy Gee—not Billy Gee dead, but Billy Gee alive.
He wanted to bring the outlaw into the county
seat of San Buenaventura, so that the people might
see that he had lived up to their expectations as a
sheriff, to vindicate his honor, the pride he felt in
himself and his position. Anybody could sneak up
behind a desperado and shoot him down, but few
had grit enough to confront that desperado and
take him alive. Warburton was going to herd
Billy Gee into the county seat alive or perish in
the attempt. So he swore to himself at the time.</p>

<p>A-straddle of a mule, driving a pack burro before
him, went the grim sheriff of San Buenaventura
County, looking for all the world like a
prospector in his patched-up overalls, old gray hat,
and boots worn down at the heels. A rough mat
of whiskers which he had let flourish untrimmed,
disguised him against the possibility of recognition.</p>

<p>Setting out from the town of Burbank, he steered
a little north of east and began a painstaking, systematic
visit to every water hole, spring, and tank
on his slow, lonely journey across the north rim
of the Mohave Desert. There were few of these
blessed oases—bright green patches in that universe
of gaunt desolation—and many hopeless miles
separated them. A man could never live in that
near-hell without water, and Warburton knew it.</p>

<p>Toward the end of August—a few weeks after
Billy Gee’s spectacular flight from the Huntington
ranch in the rented car—Warburton reached Blue
Mud Spring, a forlorn, seldom-visited trickle of
water lost in a topsy-turvy hill country some three
miles west of Lemuel’s quarter sections. Warburton
camped there four whole wretched days, waiting;
he had found a rather significant clew, as he
thought.</p>

<p>Carved on the flat surface of a soft lime boulder,
a few rods away from the spring was the legend,
“Dot H., Aug. 20, 1913.” It had been done by a
man, the work of an idle jackknife. The date
was the one on which Warburton had trailed Billy
Gee to the Huntington ranch. It was the one on
which the bandit had met Dot, reasoned the sheriff.</p>

<p>Inspection of the ground back of the boulder
showed that the owner of the jackknife had lain
there for some time. The imprint of a cartridge
belt appeared in the dirt. A short distance up a
near-by shallow gulch, his horse had pawed a hole
in the loose gravel during intervals of hunger or
impatience.</p>

<p>On the evening of Warburton’s fourth day of
solitary vigil, while he was preparing his supper
prospector fashion, the first person he had seen
since leaving the railroad hove in sight from around
a bend in the gulch. Warburton recognized him.
It was none other than Tinnemaha Pete. The old
desert rat came pattering forward, driving his two
shying burros before him, urging them onward with
wild, falsetto cries. As he neared the muddy seepage
of spring he shooed them over to drink and
toddled up to the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Howdy, stranger!” he piped. “Kinder sultry
weather, the last day or so. Better’n that damn
wind we bin havin’. You bin out in it? Lookit
my eyes!” He lifted his rheumy red lips at the
other for inspection, at the same time squinting
craftily at him. But he couldn’t penetrate the
thick disguise of beard.</p>

<p>“They sure are alkalied,” said the sheriff. “That’s
tough. You’re jest in time for a feed, friend. Sit
in. Where’re you headed?”</p>

<p>“I got claims ’crosst the hills yonder,” said Pete,
waving his skinny arm toward Geerusalem. “Sometimes
I come here, sometimes I hike to camp for
water. Prospectin’?”</p>

<p>“That’s my middle name. Lookin’ for rock with
one eye an’ watchin’ for that two-gun chap, Billy
Gee, with the other. ’Tain’t pleasant, let me tell
you.”</p>

<p>Tinnemaha Pete broke into a wild cackle. “A
big walloper like you skeart of a kid! Say, you’re
a tenderfoot, ain’t you?” He leered suddenly. “Yer
hands’re soft. I jest seen the inside of one of ’em.
You can’t fool me, mister.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t tryin’ to, dad,” grinned Warburton.
“This here is my first trip out for nigh on a year.
I bin bartendin’ for McGregor, over to Twenty-nine
Palms. You know ‘Gold-tooth’ McGregor, the
locoed Scotchman, wears a clean boiled shirt every
day, an’——”</p>

<p>“Do I know that ol’ hoss thief? An’ you bin
sellin’ booze for him? Better man never lived’n——&#160;D’ye
happen to have what’s good for snake bite?”
he tittered.</p>

<p>The sheriff dug a bottle out of his pack and
passed it to him. “’Tain’t as fine’s it might be,
but it beats nothin’,” grimaced Tinnemaha Pete,
as he wiped his mouth. “An’ after you workin’ in
that rough-house joint of McGregor’s, you’re leery
of Billy Gee! Say, d’ye know that boy’s a genius!
He’s a cat for lives an’ a fox for tricks. He’s
showed up ag’in. Ain’t you heerd? Lordy! Hell
burn my soul, if he ain’t writ another notice an’
stuck it up on the blackboard of the <i>Searchlight</i>!
Yes, he did—night afore last. ‘Warburton, I’m glad
you’ve been reëlected sheriff. You’re the only man
for the job. I mean it.’ That’s what the notice
said. Ain’t that the tantalizin’ young devil?”
Tinnemaha’s old eyes snapped proudly.</p>

<p>Warburton’s teeth set under their cover of beard.
He began apportioning the fried rashers of bacon
into two tin plates.</p>

<p>“One of these days Mr. Sheriff’ll nab that galoot.
Jest you watch,” he replied slowly. “An’ when he
does——”</p>

<p>“If he does,” hooted the old man, “he’s a Jim
Dandy. If it hadn’t bin for Lem Huntington, the
dirty——”</p>

<p>He broke off in his eccentric way, trotted over
to his pack animals, and started throwing off their
loads. Presently he had them hobbled for the
night and was back at the fire, squatting on the
ground, his heaping plate in his lap. They ate in
silence, Warburton studying his guest curiously,
listening to him mumbling over his food.</p>

<p>When the dishes had been washed and stacked
away in a kyack, and the two men had filled and
lighted their pipes, Sheriff Warburton returned to
the subject uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p>“Yessir, jest like you said, dad, if it hadn’t been
for this rancher Huntington gittin’ the drop on
Billy Gee, the sheriff would ’a’ never——”</p>

<p>“Lem Huntington’s a ornery skipjack—a louse,”
cried Tinnemaha Pete in sudden fury. “He togs
up like a tinhorn gambler an’ smokes seegars now,
an’ he’s bought a bunch of cows an’ is plantin’ a
patch in alfalfee. The cussed scrub! The ring-necked
buzzard! I know, stranger! They can’t
fool old Tinnemaha Pete. Leetle Miss Dot—there’s
a angel for you, mister! She hid out Billy Gee
that day, an’ her dad nails him for the reeward.
The t’rantula!”</p>

<p>It had grown quite dark. The purple sky was
brilliant with stars; a warm, fragrant breeze
purred down upon the night camp from over the
shattered crests of the rocky hills. In the leaping
firelight, Tinnemaha’s wizened features were distorted
with senile rage. His black, short-stemmed
pipe trembled in his bony, clawlike hand.</p>

<p>“You ain’t never met up with Billy Gee, eh?”
he asked. “I did. Yes, siree, I know him! They
ain’t a finer boy no place, they ain’t. An’ along
comes this yaller snake, Lem Huntington, an’——”</p>

<p>“How d’you know that Miss Huntington hid Billy
Gee?” interrupted Warburton casually. “You’re
jest mebby guessin’ at it. You don’t know for
sure.”</p>

<p>“Guessin’!” shrilled Tinnemaha Pete. “Guessin’,
yore gran’mother. Mrs. Liggs told me, an’ I figger
she oughter know.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“’Cos Lem Huntington—yes, he told her, that’s
why. You wait till me an’ him tangle. I found
mineral on his ground an’—damn him, he’d better
not try no shenanigans with me! Not with ol’
Peter Boyd. Mark me, stranger! I’ll cut him up.
Sure’n scat, I’ll cut him up!”</p>

<p>Puffing frantically at his wheezing cold pipe, he
bobbed his gray head at the fire, his puckered-up
eyes flickering with a mad light.</p>

<p>Warburton tossed a snarl of sagebrush on the
coals. As the flames leaped up, he glanced keenly
at the queer little shriveled figure across from
him. After an interval, he said:</p>

<p>“You reckillect the time las’ summer when Billy
Gee nailed that there other sign on the <i>Searchlight’s</i>
bulletin board, sayin’ he’d bin huntin’ for Warburton
for three year, an’——” Tinnemaha
brightened suddenly and gave a wild laugh. “Well,
the sheriff told me that he got a-hold of that paper
notice,” continued Warburton slowly. “It ’pears
like it was a fancy sort o’ wrappin’ paper, an’
Warburton he mosied ’round Geerusalem till he
found the store that used that pertickler kind. It
was a dry-goods store, run by a woman—Mrs.
Agatha Liggs.</p>

<p>“The sheriff didn’t do nothin’ about it then, figgerin’
that Billy Gee mighta jest bought suthin’
there an’ used the paper to write on. Now——”
He paused. Trained to read men’s minds by their
change of facial expression, he had been quick
to note the look of suspicion which flashed across
Tinnemaha’s wrinkled countenance. He finished his
recital with a wild guess. “What is Mrs. Liggs to
Billy Gee—aunt or mother?”</p>

<p>The old man chuckled mirthlessly. He drew a
brand out of the fire and lit his pipe. “I ain’t
ever goin’ to tell you, mister. I ain’t got no way
of knowin’. Mark ye! I don’t keep cases on other
folks’ business. Ol’ Tinnemaha Pete’s got too much
of his own to ’tend to. Am I right or wrong—what?”</p>

<p>“Aunt or mother, dad?” smiled the sheriff indulgently.
“Come on now, you ain’t foolin’ me one
bit. I’ve heerd for years as how Tinnemaha Pete
knows most everythin’ on the Mohave——”</p>

<p>“The hell you say!” exploded the desertarian.
He thrust his skinny neck across the camp fire,
and concentrated the gaze of his red-rimmed eyes
on Warburton’s whiskered face. “I don’t ever
reckillect seein’ you afore—not with that crop.
Mebby I’d know you shaved. What’s yore name?”</p>

<p>“Jack Sangerly,” lied Warburton.</p>

<p>“Spangaree? Seems to me I met——&#160;Yessir!
Agatha give me a knockdown to a dude feller,
tol’rable sort—had on ’bout five hunderd dollars o’
sporty togs. That’s the name—Spangaree. But he
was a ol’ friend of the fambly, she said.”</p>

<p>Warburton smiled. “That’s my brother, Lex, you
met,” he said blandly. “Lex’s bin edjicated in
Frisco, an’ I reckon he knew her there. Say, come
to think of it, I b’lieve he did tell me she was
Billy Gee’s mother! Sure’s shootin’! It was over
to the grading camp where Billy held up the paymaster
of the M. &amp; S., some time after.” He nodded
gravely at the flames, but he was watching the
other, hawklike.</p>

<p>Tinnemaha Pete gave vent to a paroxysm of
hysterical laughter. “’Tain’t like yore brother to
lie to you, is it, Spangaree?” he cackled, and
resumed a vigorous puffing at his pipe. Thus for
some seconds, then he added abstractedly: “But
Agatha she knowed the whole Spangaree fambly,
an’ said as how the dude feller I met an’ Jerome
was kids together.”</p>

<p>“Jerome—Liggs!” gasped Warburton. In a
twinkling, he remembered the embezzlement of the
Marysville city funds!</p>

<p>Tinnemaha Pete did not hear him. The little old
fellow’s faded blue eyes, now snapping with a
malicious fire, were riveted on him.</p>

<p>“If you’re a deteckitive, stranger, God Almighty
help ye!” he went on. “Billy Gee hangs out here.
Like as not, he’s out in the dark yonder, takin’ it
all in. Mark what I say! Close yore damn trap!”
He spoke in a heavy, cracked whisper, and Warburton
cast a furtive eye over the vicinity.</p>

<p>It was black night beyond the small circle of
firelight, the desert hills tragically still, a subtle
warning in Tinnemaha Pete’s voice and manner.
A short silence fell. The desertarian broke it with
a rough chuckle and shook his head at his pipe.</p>

<p>“But he ain’t,” he ruminated, half to himself.
“Lem Huntington knows where he is. Gol ding
his flea-bitten hide! I hope Billy cuts him up, like
I aim to. Jest let him try robbin’ ol’ Peter Boyd
of them Billy Geerusalem claims, an’ I’ll fetch him.
I’ll turn a knife into him. I’ll cut him up—chop
him to pieces. Jest nacherly make hash outer the
skunk. I sure will. Jest nacherly make hash
outer him——”</p>

<p>He mumbled on for a spell, then dropped off
to sleep, looking for all the world—sitting there
before the dying fire—like a little pile of discarded
old clothes thrown over a stump.</p>

<p>Warburton waited a few minutes, gazing thoughtfully
at him. At last, getting cautiously to his
feet, he saddled the mule and struck out for the
Huntington ranch. Tinnemaha Pete had given him
enough of a clew to go on. More important still,
Jerome Liggs and Billy Gee were one and the
same. Jerome Liggs, who had disappeared three
years ago as if the earth had opened and swallowed
him, was alive, here, on the point of capture!
Warburton rode slowly, warily along. This was
the biggest hour of his whole life. He was on the
eve of the greatest triumph of his career.</p>

<p>“I’m a-goin’ to git you, Billy Gee. I’m a-goin’
to git you!” he murmured into the night.</p>

<h2 title='XV—The Potent Influence' id='chXV'>
  CHAPTER XV—THE POTENT INFLUENCE
</h2>

<p>As has been said, Geerusalem was at the time
the Mecca of the gregarious creatures designated
as wildcatters—ruthless, scoundrelly gentlemen
who wax fat by selling worthless blocks of
fabulous mining stock to gullibles and trusting innocents
in far-away places, women being for the
most part their easier victims. To-day, they were
the power in Geerusalem, and Mrs. Liggs in her
talk with Lex Sangerly had not exaggerated the
methods of these money-grabbing rascals one whit.
They controlled the camp and the representatives of
the law. They had the respectable citizenry figuratively
by the throat, the newspapers truckling to
their wishes. Briefly, they did what they pleased;
not altogether openly, however. There was a grand
jury down at the county seat, a hundred miles or
so away, that might happen to train an eye in
their direction, and certain State officials who might
start an investigation.</p>

<p>Everything then that was done unlawfully was
done under a veneer of mystery, or lacking that,
“framed” so cleverly as to deceive the wiliest inquisitor,
should such a rare bird appear on the
ground.</p>

<p>In the first place, the master mind of this invisible
organization was Jule Quintell. He was
a formidable character physically and mentally, merciless
at the base, diplomatic and rash by turns;
in many ways a dual personality who could be
trusted to put over whatever he undertook. His
was the gift to scheme, to set the stage, to spring
the trap, to wrest the holdings from the victim,
whether by eviction or the six-shooter, for property—mining
property—was what Quintell and his confederates
wanted and were getting. Individual
claims and groups of claims were piling in on
them, and as fast as they were acquired they were
parceled off, given a name, put through the process
of incorporation, and the stock floated. Exquisitely
engraved certificates found their way across the
continent to the gullibles and trusting innocents,
who dreamed in vain of enormous dividends which
would set them on Easy Street in short order.</p>

<p>Claims that gave promise of paying were never
thus exploited, however. They were carefully prospected,
“dressed up” if they did not fulfill expectations,
and through the medium of glowing reports
published in the subsidized newspapers, they sold
for fancy prices; for there were always rich suckers
drifting into this infant prodigy of gold camps,
looking to invest.</p>

<p>Boss Quintell’s associates, whom Mrs. Liggs had
designated as the “brains” of the element were,
even as she had said, assayers, mining engineers,
surveyors, stockbrokers. There were more than a
score of them; as smug and high-handed a coterie
of crooks as ever sidestepped the penitentiary.
Against their influence and methods, the reputable
competitor was promptly starved out, forced to
seek a living in other fields. The monopoly of
swindling was perfected to a point where the professions
most intimately affiliated with mining were
included, these being amply represented in the
trusted membership of the magic circle.</p>

<p>And yet, taken as a whole, this aggregation of
grafters which had its tentacles spread out across
the entire Geerusalem mining district, slowly killing
the spirit of industry and discovery without
which no camp can live, were of themselves not
only lacking in strength but devoid of the necessary
courage to defy the decent element of the town,
had the latter voiced objection to their tactics.
Whatever influence the Quintell crowd possessed,
the very success of their lawless enterprise, in fact
the death grip they had on the camp—these things
they owed to that majority of population that seems
as much a part in the founding of a settlement in
the wilderness, as its tents and rock huts—the
underworld.</p>

<p>Here had forgathered the undesirable from the
four winds—gunmen, thieves, criminals of high
and low degree, and they kept flocking in and plied
their vicious trades without fear of interruption.
And flocking in, also, came the type of woman
that men know best and fall easier prey to because
they do, while added to these denizens of
the city’s slums, were the drifters, adventurers, and
saloon hangers-on, all bent on getting their share
of gold at some other fellow’s expense.</p>

<p>With this formidable army of undesirables at
its back, the Quintell crowd ruled Geerusalem, and
from it, chose its tools who went out at night
and beat up men, drove them off their claims,
killed them if they proved too troublesome. These
tools got money for their work. The element as
a whole got protection—license to carry on as its
membership saw fit without interference from the
local authorities, whom Quintell, through bribe and
political influence, held in the hollow of his hand.
Crime thrived accordingly, and the remote cases
that did come up for trial in the courts proved
ridiculous farces conducted more to impress the
County Bar Association at the distant county seat
that jurisprudence was on the job, than as a matter
of stern equity.</p>

<p>Now, on the very day that Lemuel Huntington
had brought Billy Gee a prisoner into camp, Quintell’s
field men reported that Tinnemaha Pete had
discovered a rich gold ledge on the Huntington
ranch. Late that afternoon, while Lex Sangerly
and Detectives Coates and Tyler were searching for
the outlaw’s loot at the ranch house half a mile
away, Quintell experts were investigating the
ground with a view of determining the extent of
the deposit and estimating its value.</p>

<p>They returned, bringing word that the find was
a bonanza from the grass roots, that the hill on
the west end of the Huntington ranch carried the
croppings of three parallel ledges that apparently
were a continuation of the Geerusalem mineral belt.
Tinnemaha Pete’s location notices were made out in
the names of Peter Boyd and Jerome Liggs.</p>

<p>Jule Quintell and his confederates held a two-hour
meeting that evening. They listened to the
reports of the experts, heard them voice the opinion
that the new discovery promised to be a monumental
strike, eclipsing anything ever opened up
before in the district. They sat silent, grim of face,
ominous, and blew wreaths of smoke toward the
ceiling. Presently they began discussing the matter.</p>

<p>They must acquire this ground. The Geerusalem
mines were good producers, but here was something
far better. Moreover, a sister camp on the same
mineral belt, only four miles distant, meant that
its owners would be millionaires overnight. It was
not a proposition of doing business with Tinnemaha
Pete and Jerome Liggs. Whoever these desert
rats were did not enter into the issue, for though
they had found and located the deposit, they had
no legal claim to it. Lemuel Huntington owned
the ground; it was patented ground. Lemuel Huntington
was the man they must deal with—Lem
used to hobnob with the crowd before he captured
Billy Gee and got a start in the world.</p>

<p>The meeting was held in Boss Quintell’s spacious
private office in the Brokers’ Exchange Building, a
three-story frame structure that housed the elaborate
publicity and advertising departments—so essential
to successful wildcatting—of three of Geerusalem’s
most prominent stockbrokers.</p>

<p>Messengers began arriving, one to say that Huntington
and his daughter had left for San Francisco,
another with the information that railroad detectives
were occupying the ranch house.</p>

<p>Quintell advanced the scheme to be followed for
the acquisition of the bonanza strike. “Big George”
Rankin, owner of the Northern Saloon and dominant
figure in the camp’s underworld, was in San
Francisco on business. He was wired to meet
Huntington and his daughter at the ferry terminal,
follow them, and telegraph back the name of the
hotel they put up at. Dick Lennox, a young mining
engineer—one of the lesser lights of the gang,
but more intimate with the rancher than any member
of it—was chosen to go to the metropolis and
try to bargain for the purchase of the ranch. The
thing was to see Huntington before he returned to
Geerusalem, for, as Quintell pointed out, it was
just possible that Dot’s father, once back in the
country, would hear rumors of the discovery of
mineral on his ground and refuse to sell except at
his own terms. Lemuel, then, must not surmise
there was one pennyweight of gold on his land.
The land must be bought for a song, as it were.</p>

<p>Receipt by Quintell of Lennox’s telegram telling
of his failure to turn the deal, along with Rankin’s
report charging Lennox with betraying the
gang to win favor with Dot, infuriated the boss of
Geerusalem and his associates, made the mining
engineer a marked man, whose arrival in camp
was awaited by gunmen with instructions to “bump
him off” as quietly as they could. But Lennox, returning
unexpectedly, got word of his danger from
a member of the gang, who, yielding to the other’s
entreaties, hid him in a rear office room, Lennox
agreeing to leave as soon as it was dark.</p>

<p>Terrified at the startling predicament in which
he found himself and not daring to risk flight by
train or automobile, Lennox in his extremity thought
of Lex Sangerly, who he remembered was conducting
an investigation at the Huntington ranch.
If Sangerly was there, he knew he could prevail
on him to drive him to Mirage; if he was not, the
ranch because of its isolation would furnish him a
secure hiding place until such time as he could find
his way in safety out of the country.</p>

<p>With nightfall then, he struck out afoot for the
ranch. He held to the deserted back streets and
went fast, stumbling along in his feverish haste,
glancing over his shoulder. When he reached the
outskirts of camp, where the rough rock cabins of
the squatters began to thin out and the vast emptiness
of Soapweed Plains became discernible through
the wide mouth of Geerusalem Gulch, he breathed
easier and slackened his pace. He had eluded the
assassins. He was safe!</p>

<p>But though he had been one of the Quintell crowd,
Lennox had never realized the depth of perfidy in
its ranks. The very man who had warned him
and given him shelter, had done so merely to deliver
him into the hands of the killers. Therefore, no
sooner had he reached a lonely point beyond the
camp’s confines, where the sagebrush and greasewood
rose thick on each side of the road, than he
heard the quick patter of running feet behind him.
The moon was shining. As Lennox turned, he
made out four men bearing down on him less than
a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>“Hey, Lennox, hold on a minute! The gang’s
straightened things out. The boss wants you to
come back,” called out a jovial voice.</p>

<p>The fugitive halted undecidedly for an instant.
Then, recognizing his pursuers as uncouthly dressed
fellows whom he was sure he did not know, he
took to his heels. Instantly a volley of shots roared
out, and a hail of bullets went screaming past him.
In the grip of terror, he redoubled his speed, dashing
desperately onward, gazing about him for some
means of escape. Presently his eyes lighted on a
shack looming black against the background of hill,
a few yards to one side of the road. Just as he
discovered it his pursuers sent another swarm of
bullets after him. This time they got him. His
leg suddenly buckled under him, and he pitched
headlong to the ground.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” he cried frenziedly, making a
futile effort to get to his feet.</p>

<p>An answering shout broke from the quartet.
Lennox glared around and saw them coming, racing
toward him. He could hear the gravel crunching
nearer with every footfall. He knew that they
would shoot him where he lay, without mercy,
as they would shoot a dog, and his horrible thought
picked him off the road and sent him crawling
madly for the shack.</p>

<p>He reached the door and pounded on it.</p>

<p>“Open! They’re going to murder me. Open, in
God’s name!” he panted distractedly.</p>

<p>There was a movement inside the cabin; then
the door opened.</p>

<p>“Come in!” said a man’s voice out of the darkness.</p>

<p>Lennox dragged himself inside and lay half-fainting
on the floor, gasping for breath.</p>

<p>Outside he could hear the sounds of the Quintell
men approaching the shack. Then the voice of his
unknown deliverer broke quietly through the place.</p>

<p>“Stop where you are, strangers!”</p>

<p>A heavy silence followed his words.</p>

<p>“We’re deputy sheriffs, pal. You’ve got a man
in there we want,” said one of the men gruffly.</p>

<p>“Let’s see yore authority. Depities kin always
flash a tin buzzer. Let’s see yourn.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the authority. Do you turn him
over or not?”</p>

<p>The occupant of the shack gave a low chuckle.
“You sure talk like a depity, sport,” he said in
genial tones. “But don’t you never let Sheriff
Warburton hear you make a crack like that——”</p>

<p>The deafening crash of revolvers cut him short,
as, without warning, the gunmen fired. The bullets
tore through the partly opened door, and a shower
of splinters fell on Lennox.</p>

<p>“Get him, fellows! Get the——” cursed the
spokesman.</p>

<p>“At yore risk, men!” called out the unknown.
He threw the door wide and began shooting with
a rapidity that set the mining engineer, wounded
and terrified though he was, marveling vaguely.</p>

<p>The battle ended as suddenly as it had begun.
A deep silence followed. Soon Lennox heard his
deliverer moving through the dark interior and got
a glimpse of him as he walked out into the moonlight.
He returned presently and halted in the
gloom.</p>

<p>“You hurt bad?” he asked. He spoke calmly,
his voice pleasingly low.</p>

<p>“My leg is broken,” said Lennox. “I don’t know
that I can ever repay you for saving my life,
friend.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t takin’ pay for savin’ a man’s life. I
know what it is to be a mouse with the cat after
it. I’ll fix up yore leg the best I kin in the dark.
’Tain’t safe to make a light. You got to have a
doctor, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Not from Geerusalem. It would be signing my
own death warrant. Quintell and his gang are
after me.”</p>

<p>“Huh! So, that’s who they were, eh? Purty
hard-boiled bunch, that. Now let’s see that busted
leg.”</p>

<p>Kneeling on the floor beside Lennox, he began
bandaging above and below the wound to stop the
flow of blood. He worked in the dark dexterously,
tearing long strips of cloth and binding them tightly
around the fractured limb. At the end of ten
minutes he rose to his feet and lit a cigarette and
stood for a moment at the door, listening.</p>

<p>“Why’re they tryin’ to git you?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“They sent me to Frisco to buy a ranch—the
Huntington ranch; you must know it. Anyway, I
couldn’t turn the deal, and they blamed me. Say,
do you suppose there’s any danger of blood-poisoning?”</p>

<p>The other did not reply. Lennox, propped on
his elbow, waited anxiously, a new alarm creeping
into his heart. Silhouetted statuelike in the rectangle
of moonlight formed by the open door, stood
the stranger. He stood thus, motionless, for a
short interval. Then he inhaled deeply of his
cigarette, tossed it away, and came over to Lennox.</p>

<p>“You give me an idea,” he said, with an odd
chuckle. “I’ll git you to the Huntington ranch.
I figger I kin hustle up a doctor who won’t talk.”
He dropped to his haunches beside the other.
“Here, ketch me ’round the neck. I’m packin’
you! My hoss is down the gulch a ways.”</p>

<p>With the wounded man clinging to his back,
he padlocked the door and struck out through the
brush.</p>

<p>“What happened to them—the four, you know?”
asked Lennox, glancing about over the ground. “It
isn’t possible they escaped, and——”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, it’s healthy to keep yore front yard
clean, pardner. Folks are’ awful curious—if you
know what I mean,” was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>The unknown’s horse stood tethered in a small
draw. Helping Lennox into the saddle, the man
climbed on behind. They rode on in silence for
many minutes, following the deeply rutted, dusty
road that wormed its way among the windrows of
sand and boulders which dotted Soapweed Plains
at this point. Behind them the Geerusalem hills
rose into the sky—a jumbled, massive gray pile,
looking like some great, nameless monster crouching
in the night.</p>

<p>“What they want the ranch for?” said the stranger,
breaking the long silence.</p>

<p>“It’s immensely rich—in mineral. I hear it’s the
richest gold strike in the district. But they wouldn’t
sell.”</p>

<p>“By <i>they</i>, you mean Lem Huntington, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“He was willing enough, at first. But his daughter——Well,
to tell the truth, it was a dirty
scheme. I was to tell them the ranch was wanted
for a resort—one of those free-and-easy hangouts
for the sporting crowd. It seems as if there’s a
grave in the garden—her mother’s grave. And the
girl wouldn’t—I certainly understand how she
feels.”</p>

<p>“Her mother’s grave,” repeated the unknown very
slowly.</p>

<p>The horse jogged along with its double burden.
Far ahead, a tiny blur of black showed the location
of the Huntington ranch.</p>

<p>“My leg is hurting me fearfully,” said Lennox
at last. “Damn them! You don’t think there’s
danger of blood-poisoning, do you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard a lot about Miss Huntington. They
say she’s a mighty fine gal. I’d kinder like to know
the pertick’lars if you don’t mind tellin’ ’em. No,
I don’t guess there’s danger o’ blood-poisonin’.
You’ll be all right in a month or two, mebby.”</p>

<p>Lennox groaned at the cheerless prospect that
confronted him.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he began the story of the
efforts of the Quintell gang to purchase the Huntington
holdings. His indignation over their treatment
of him loosened his tongue, caused him to
overlook not one detail that might go to illustrate
the infamous methods by which they operated.
From their discovery that the two prospectors,
Peter Boyd and Jerome Liggs, had located the
bonanza claims, how he had been delegated to talk
Huntington into selling, his meeting with Big George
Rankin in San Francisco and later with Dot and
her father in the Golden West Hotel; all this he
related and concluded with the quarrel he and
Rankin had had on the street following his failure
to buy the ranch.</p>

<p>“An’ he said that—that Quintell mebby could
use her, as his stenographer?” said the stranger.
His voice was like ice in the other’s ear.</p>

<p>“Yes, and about as nasty as a man could say it.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t this Rankin the feller that owns the Northern
Saloon—big walloper with a red face, sorter
straw boss o’ the Stingeree bunch?”</p>

<p>“That’s he. I’ve heard he was bad clean through,
one of the worst characters——”</p>

<p>“I know all about them kind, pal. They sure
kin squeal, when you start workin’ on ’em. Use
her as his stenographer, eh?” he repeated, as if to
himself.</p>

<p>They rode along in silence after that, save for
the occasional groan of suffering that broke from
Lennox. Within a few hundred yards of the
Huntington ranch, the stranger drew rein and slid
to the ground.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to let you make it in alone,” he said
in low tones. “You’ll find two detectives there—Sangerly’s
men. Jest holler, an’ they’ll come out.
Don’t tell nobody about meetin’ me or about the
shootin’ or anythin’. You understand? If they ask
questions, jest say Quintell’s men shot you, an’
that a friend took you in, an’ give you a hoss.”</p>

<p>“I’ll certainly never forget you, old man, for
what you’ve done,” replied the other. “My name is
Dick Lennox. I’m a mining engineer, and any
time I can be of service to you, why——But
who am I indebted to? What is your name?”</p>

<p>“There’ll be a doctor out here in an hour. You
kin trust him. If you’ll hang the bridle rein over
the horn of the saddle, she’ll come back to me.
Mollie, git a-goin’!” he added, slapping the animal
on the flanks.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, when Detective Coates came
out to turn the horse into the field, after he and
his partner had carried Lennox into the house, he
found it gone. In the distance, toward Geerusalem,
he heard it galloping along, and concluded that, in
obedience to its natural instincts, it was returning
home.</p>

<h2 title='XVI—The Hand of Quintell' id='chXVI'>
  CHAPTER XVI—THE HAND OF QUINTELL
</h2>

<p>The Lennox episode threw the forces that governed
Geerusalem into a vengeful attitude, not
unmixed with doubt, and set working the stealthy
brotherhood under Big George Rankin to ascertain
who had aided the mining engineer, not only in
escaping assassination and mysteriously disappearing,
but in killing four of the element’s most daring
and dependable gunmen. But far-reaching and
thorough though the investigation proved, not the
least light was shed on the matter. All that there
seemed to be to the incident was that the four had
been found dead on the road, near the mouth of
Geerusalem Gulch, a hundred yards or more from
a deserted cabin, and that Lennox, unarmed, according
to the statement of the man who had given
him temporary refuge in his office, had got away.</p>

<p>What gave the occurrence a sinister aspect and
set the Quintell gang guessing, was the fact that
this was the first time a plot of theirs had miscarried,
with such disastrous results—the first time
their assassins had been wiped out to the last man.
Lennox, it was argued, given guns and ammunition
could not have possibly shot four men without being
killed. Besides, it was known that he was
ignorant in the use of firearms. He had received
help then. Doubtless, he had led the four into a
trap to be slaughtered. By whom? Could it be
possible that the decent citizenry of the camp had
organized, that they had launched a secret war of
extermination with a view of shattering the power
of the element? Was the Quintell dictatorship
threatened? These and other questions were discussed
by the brains of the camp’s control at a
conference held in the Brokers’ Exchange Building
and laughed at by their big, arrogant leader.</p>

<p>“Let them organize!” he whipped out harshly,
his hard eyes sweeping the circle seated around
the conference table. “Let them start heckling the
combination, if they think they’re lucky! We’ll
take them down the line! If they’re looking for
blood we’ll swim the camp in it. I’m handling
the thing, see? We’re going to ascertain conditions,
then we’ll strike suddenly. They won’t have
a chance. The first matter to be cleared up is
Lennox, the damned traitor knows too much. He
must be found and stopped. It’s worth five thousand
dollars to us to put him where he can’t talk.
I have his Pasadena home address, and men will
leave on the night train to get him, if he’s gone
there. Others are investigating the scene of the
killing to see if they can pick up his trail. We’ll
get him. We have to get him, or he’ll get us.
Once he begins spouting and that moss-back grand
jury begins digging around up here, we may as
well begin jumping into Mexico.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the meeting and just as his
confederates were preparing to depart, Quintell said:</p>

<p>“Huntington has returned home, and the two
railroad detectives are in camp with their baggage.
I’ve been informed by the Western Union night
operator they were wired to return to Los Angeles.
Huntington is alone at the ranch. That means, the
ranch is ours. I’ll have the quit-claim by midnight
to-night. In the morning, Rankin will rush a bunch
of men out there to attend to Peter Boyd and
Jerome Liggs. By the way, does anybody know
where Huntington’s daughter is staying in Frisco?
Well, no matter. I’ll find out. If the old bum
don’t come through decent, he gets the limit. The
new strike, gentlemen, is as good as ours.”</p>

<p>When they were gone, Quintell sat back in his
swivel chair and began glancing through a fistful
of that day’s mail. He halted over one letter,
frowned at it a moment, and pressed the buzzer
under the edge of his desk. That letter bore the
signature: “Lex Sangerly, Division Superintendent,
M. &amp; S. R. R. Co.”</p>

<p>The door leading into the outer offices opened,
and a tall hawk-eyed, middle-aged man entered.
He came forward with long, noiseless strides,
watching his employer over his glasses.</p>

<p>“Harrison, how about this?” snapped Quintell,
handing over Sangerly’s letter to the other. “The
date! Look at the date! It’s ten days since we
received——”</p>

<p>“Permit me, Mr. Quintell,” broke in Harrison
suavely. “You instructed me to file it, pending receipt
of certificates of record from the county
recorder, if you will remember. They came to-day,
sir. The surveyors will complete their work
this afternoon, I understand. In fact, the only
thing remaining to be done is to draw up papers
of incorporation of the Lucky Boy Placer Company,
if that is the name you have decided on for the
group.”</p>

<p>“Draw them up immediately! Rush them
through! That name will do as well as any other.
On your way out, send me in a stenographer to
take dictation.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, Mr. Quintell.” The man hesitated. “But
if you intend to answer Mr. Sangerly’s letter—er—you
were in conference, sir, and I wouldn’t disturb
you. He’s out there, waiting to speak with
you.”</p>

<p>The other stared, then rose slowly to his feet.
“Sangerly? Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Division superintendent of the——”</p>

<p>A curse broke from Quintell. He stood with his
powerful hands resting on the desk, his penetrating
coal-black eyes playing slowly over the room for
a few moments.</p>

<p>“I want them to find gold on the Lucky Boy,
Harrison, understand?” he said in low, harsh tones,
gazing intently at the man. “I want you to go out
there this evening, see? You know the vicinity of
the proposed right of way. Salt it! The thing
must be done thoroughly, cleverly. Salt it, in
patches, on either side of the bench marks. Mark
those patches. When I take Sangerly out there in
the morning, you come along with us. It’ll be up
to you to take samples of the ground. Those
samples must wash gold, understand?</p>

<p>“I’m leaving this matter to you, Harrison. If
we put over this deal you get a thousand-dollar
bonus and a substantial salary increase. But there
must be no slip. When you do business with a
railroad company you’re going against the real
thing. Remember that! They’ve got the dough and
they’re wise as hell.” He turned abruptly and,
going over to a large safe on the opposite side of
the room, took from its interior a wide-mouthed
bottle containing several ounces of placer gold.
“Here’s your salt. Use it all if you have to, but
make a good job of it,” he added, giving Harrison
the bottle. “You have your instructions. See that
you follow them. Now, show him in.”</p>

<p>The man bowed respectfully and left the room.</p>

<p>Lex Sangerly, in obedience to a telegram received
from his father, had left San Francisco hurriedly
and arrived in Geerusalem that morning.
Motoring out to the Huntington ranch, he found
Coates and Tyler preparing to leave for the south,
temporarily called away from the Billy Gee chase
to take up some work of more immediate importance.
Lex had a long talk with Lennox, as the
latter lay stretched out in bed, his leg in a plaster
cast, and from what the mining engineer told him,
concluded that far from exaggerating the ruthlessness
and power of the Quintell combination, Mrs.
Liggs, in her warning to him had quite obviously
given him but the barest glimpse of existing conditions.
Lemuel, attired in a rakishly-cut corduroy
suit and the best that money could buy in buckled
boots, smoked his cigar with amazing dignity and
talked cattle raising with Lex, like the owner of
ten thousand herds.</p>

<p>Driving the two detectives to camp, Sangerly
bade them good-by and steered his roadster up
through the jam of traffic to the Brokers’ Exchange
Building. Now, at Harrison’s invitation, he
entered Quintell’s inner office and waited, while
the boss of Geerusalem, without deigning his visitor
so much as a glance, finished perusing his
mail. He sat back finally and trained his piercing,
black eyes on the other.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sangerly, I presume,” he began, with cold
business courtesy, and paused awkwardly as he
recognized in his caller the stranger with whom he
had collided on the sidewalk in front of Mrs. Liggs’
store one evening some weeks before.</p>

<p>He got up out of his chair now and approached
Lex, smiling deprecatingly, his hand extended.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sangerly, I owe you my humblest apology
as regards my rude behavior on the occasion of
our first meeting. I have worried considerably
about it and have made inquiries in an effort to
learn your name and whereabouts. The fact that
I had been drinking does not, of course, excuse my
conduct. However, I sincerely hope you will forgive
me for insulting you as I did. I am extremely
sorry, sir.”</p>

<p>“The incident is past and, so far as I am concerned,
forgotten, Mr. Quintell,” said Lex pleasantly.
“I, in turn, am sorry that you let it bother
you for, to be candid, I haven’t given it a second
thought.”</p>

<p>Quintell drew up a chair before his desk, motioned
the other into it, and resumed his own.
He brought out a box of choice cigars and held
a lighted match for his visitor.</p>

<p>“You doubtless surmise my errand, Mr. Quintell,”
said Lex presently. “It is in relation to——”</p>

<p>“For the second time, I must ask you to bear
with me,” broke in Quintell, picking up the letter
he had discussed with Harrison. “Through a regrettable
oversight on the part of my secretary,
your communication was not called to my attention
until fifteen mintes ago. You should have had an
answer a week since.”</p>

<p>“It hardly matters. I have been away from the
office since I wrote you,” said Lex and added:
“To get down to business, Mr. Quintell, I see that
your surveyors are going ahead, that you seem
disposed to block construction of a branch line
into Geerusalem.”</p>

<p>“Discourage the coming of the railroad!” burst
out the other. “Why, Mr. Sangerly, I’m not altogether
a madman! I want the railroad. The camp
is a unit for it. It spells progress, greater industry,
greater opportunity!”</p>

<p>Lex nodded. “My father, who is Western manager
of the road, instructed me to speak with you
quite plainly on the matter. To begin, every landowner
along the entire fifty-three miles of proposed
line, from the station of Mirage to Geerusalem, has
granted us the privilege of a right of way for the
asking. Coöperation has been extended to us on
every hand. We were encouraged and we proceeded
with construction. Almost twenty miles of
track have been laid out of Mirage.</p>

<p>“To-day, at this end, we are confronted with a
situation that, were it not so grave in its ultimate
results, would be ridiculous to a degree. I refer
to that old, abandoned group of claims—the Lucky
Boy group, I believe you called them in your letter—which
has suddenly come to life. As we both
know, they are located across the mouth of Geerusalem
Gulch, boasting as their only improvements
a dilapidated twelve-foot-square shack. We have
learned that you and seven other men have quite
recently filed on these claims, as placer ground.
Since the proposed branch must cross this ground
of yours to reach the terminal site here in camp,
we assume your action was taken with the deliberate
intention of making us come to you. Now, the
point is, Mr. Quintell, do you gentlemen propose to
grant us the same right of way privileges we have
been receiving, or are you simply out to hold
us up?”</p>

<p>It was a blunt question, but Quintell laughed it
away in his gayest manner.</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Sangerly, you are utterly in error.
You don’t seem to view the situation from the right
angle. In much the same way, not being a railroad
man, I myself cannot fully appreciate your method
of reasoning. Just for instance, what would you
say if I told you that the Lucky Boy group is
perhaps one of the richest placer-gold deposits discovered
in California in the last twenty years?”</p>

<p>He had risen and was standing before his visitor,
his hands thrust into his pockets, his shrewd eyes
fixed on Lex.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he qualified impressively, “when I
say richest, please don’t mistake my meaning. Indications
on the surface are such as to leave no
doubt that gold is present in enormous quantities.
This, Mr. Sangerly, is an actual fact. Moreover,
I will prove the truth of my statement whenever
it suits your convenience.”</p>

<p>Lex regarded him in silence for some seconds.
“How long since you made this discovery?” he
asked at last.</p>

<p>“About two weeks ago. We’ve been keeping it
quiet—which is a hard thing to do in a mining
camp. We’ve had men looking up the records to
be certain that we were not going up against a
hang-fire title and subsequent litigation. To-morrow
we intend to plaster the front pages of the
newspapers with the story. Armed guards will be
placed on the property to protect it from claim
jumpers.” He paused, dropped back into his chair,
and nursed one knee in his hands. “So, Mr. Sangerly,
you surely must appreciate our reluctance in
complying with your company’s request for permission
to lay tracks across this ground. It is far
too valuable, we believe. Frankly, it is a question
of money with us, and you can scarcely criticize
us if we regard the matter from a purely financial
standpoint. But to say that we are deliberately
trying to hold your people up, that statement, Mr.
Sangerly, is both uncalled for and unkind.”</p>

<p>Lex lit his cigar thoughtfully. He frowned at
the elaborate rug at his feet. Quintell watched him
intently.</p>

<p>“Of course, if my company desired a right of
way over the Lucky Boy group badly enough you
would grant it the privilege of purchase—for a
reasonable figure?” said Lex presently. “You just
stated that the railroad would prove a big asset to
the camp.”</p>

<p>“In view of the fact that my partners and myself
have interests here that would be indirectly
benefited by better transportation facilities, yes, we
would be glad to consider such a purchase. You
must understand, Mr. Sangerly, that we have no
fight with your company. The whole thing is a
cold business proposition. If you know the difference
between lode and placer mining you must
realize that the latter’s workable area is strictly
surface. Such being the case, a railroad bed passing
over gold-bearing gravel——”</p>

<p>“Approximately, what would it stand us to get
a single-track right of way over this ground, Mr.
Quintell? I would like to wire immediate word to
my people,” broke in Lex.</p>

<p>The other rubbed his heavy chin thoughtfully.
“The price would have to be based on the valuation
per cubic yard of pay dirt over which the roadbed
must of necessity have to pass. This strip, as you
can readily see, would be lost to development; we
could not work it. Samples of the gravel would
be taken and a thorough assayer’s test made to
ascertain its average gold-bearing value. On the
whole, Mr. Sangerly, we want only what is legitimately
coming to us—no more, no less.”</p>

<p>Lex rose to go. “In my opinion, you should
encourage the construction of this branch line rather
than place an obstacle in the way of its building.
At best it is only a venture, depending entirely on
the continued prosperity of Geerusalem, and it is
costing more per mile than any strip of road the
company has laid in years. I’d like to look over
this placer ground, Mr. Quintell—that is, take samples
of the gravel. When would it be convenient
for you to accompany me?”</p>

<p>“I was about to suggest that you come here about—say,
ten o’clock, to-morrow morning. A party of
us are motoring down there, and I’d be happy to
have you join us,” said Quintell genially, getting to
his feet. “Allow me also to extend to you the
hospitality of my home while you are here, Mr.
Sangerly. The hotels are abominable. I have a
modern little bungalow, an extra room, and all the
city’s conveniences—including a Japanese chef, who
is really a culinary artist.” He laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s indeed a tempting invitation, and I’d snap
it up if it weren’t for the fact that I’m pretty
comfortably established at the Huntington ranch,”
said Lex.</p>

<p>Quintell’s black eyes opened in genuine surprise.
“Well! So you’re a friend of old Lem’s, too?
There’s a corking fine type of Westerner for you,
Sangerly. Too bad it’s dying out, going the way of
the traditional hospitality of the West. While I
think of it, how is Miss Dot getting on?”</p>

<p>“Remarkably well. She has taken up a number
of special summer courses at the University of California
and is forging right ahead.” Lex paused
and added with a smile: “She’s bent on immortalizing
Geerusalem and Soapweed Plains. She’s writing
a novel.”</p>

<p>“A novel?” echoed Quintell, interested.</p>

<p>“Nothing less, and on no more romantic a personage
than Billy Gee, the bandit. There are other
notables in the story, for instance, yourself, myself,
the wildcat bunch, Mrs. Agatha Liggs, who used to
keep the little dry-goods store, Sheriff Warburton,
and a lot of others. I’ll wager she’ll dispose of
five thousand copies in this section alone. Besides,
it is quite probable my company will purchase
several thousand for advertising purposes.”</p>

<p>Quintell looked pleased. “She can count on me
for five hundred; you may tell Lem that. Your
mention of Mrs. Liggs reminds me—do you happen
to know if she’s related to a Jerome Liggs?”</p>

<p>Lex stopped in the act of putting on his hat.
The other was quick to note the odd look that
came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Jerome was her son,” he said slowly. “Why do
you ask? I’m just a little curious.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that he’s dead? You said—<i>was</i>
her son?” countered Quintell adroitly. But his manner
was plainly skeptical, and Lex saw it.</p>

<p>“That is what I’ve been told. It isn’t possible
that you’ve heard——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Some days ago I happened to run
across an old transaction in which his name appeared.
There was a sum of money involved—nothing
to speak of, though,” lied Quintell glibly.</p>

<p>But Sangerly did not believe him. As he walked
out of the Brokers’ Exchange Building, he reviewed
the matter in his mind and decided to reopen the
subject with Quintell in the morning. Could Mrs.
Liggs have deceived him regarding Jerome’s death?
Could it really be that she had deliberately lied—Mrs.
Liggs, the most upstanding, the best little
woman he had ever known? He would not allow
himself to believe it. The very thought was a
sacrilege. And yet he remembered now that she
had never so much as mentioned Jerome’s name,
since the day he met her at the store, when, seated
in the living room, he had inquired after his boyhood
chum. Indeed, now that he recalled that meeting,
it did seem as if she had acted strangely and
that she had scarcely referred to her son as a bereaved
mother would; and if any mother ever
loved her son, it was Mrs. Liggs.</p>

<p>Thinking thus, he made his way down the
crowded street to the Miners’ Hotel, called for his
mail, and arranged with Merriman, the proprietor,
to hold his room for him as headquarters for railroad
officials who would visit the camp from time to
time. As he turned to walk out of the hotel office,
a copy of that afternoon’s <i>Searchlight</i> lying on
the desk caught his eye. He glanced at it idly,
then stared; and his bewilderment grew as he read
the double column of black-face type, announcing
what was reported to be a rumor that Tinnemaha
Pete Boyd and Jerome Liggs, prospectors, had made
the sensational gold strike of the year. The account,
conforming with the style so popular among
certain newspapers to swell their sales, was staggering
to the eye but hazy as to details, and merely
hinted that the new bonanza was situated in a
range southwest of camp.</p>

<p>Now, while the coincidental appearance of the
name of the man of whom he had just been thinking,
dumfounded Lex for the moment, it had a
diametrically opposite effect on Jule Quintell when
he saw it.</p>

<p>Following Sangerly’s departure, the boss of Geerusalem
had settled back in his chair and fallen
into moody reflection.</p>

<p>“It just might be that this old fossil, Tinnemaha
Pete, entered the son’s name in those claim notices,
instead of the mother’s,” he muttered to himself.
“Sangerly says he’s dead, and he spoke as if he
knew. Well, nothing like being sure.” He reached
for a pencil and pad and wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Jerome Liggs, wanted for robbery of Marysville city
    treasury three years ago, is operating claims on Lemuel
    Huntington ranch near Geerusalem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leaving the note unsigned he read it over grimly
and rang for Harrison. That individual came bolting
into the room almost instantly, carrying in one
outflung hand a copy of the <i>Searchlight</i> and banging
the door after him.</p>

<p>“McQuaid’s spilled the beans!” he cried. “Look
at this, sir! He published the story of the strike—the
Huntington ranch story, sir!”</p>

<p>Quintell glared at his secretary in unbelief; then
his big body stiffened, and his face purpled with
rage. He tore the paper from the other’s grasp
and skimmed through the account with flaming
eyes. A frightful oath burst from him.</p>

<p>“Damn him! The bonehead! Another traitor!”
he sputtered savagely. “I’ll teach the fool a lesson.
He’ll pay for this——” He snatched the receiver
off the telephone and called up the <i>Searchlight</i>
editorial rooms. A man’s voice answered presently.</p>

<p>“Hello! This you, McQuaid?”</p>

<p>“Mr. McQuaid is no longer here. Is there anything
I can do——”</p>

<p>“What do you mean—no longer there? Say, who
is this talking? I said, McQuaid—the editor. Tell
him Quintell wants him.”</p>

<p>“I got you the first time, friend,” was the quiet
reply. “Mr. McQuaid sold out this morning. The
<i>Searchlight</i> is under new management.”</p>

<p>Quintell took a slow breath. His rage cooled.
“This is rather unexpected news. I wasn’t prepared
for it. May I ask who bought him out?”</p>

<p>“Los Angeles people. We are reorganizing the
paper, making a change in policy, and all that
sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Quintell and added: “Is there any
truth to that Boyd and Liggs gold-strike story? I
see you’ve featured it.”</p>

<p>“Why, we’re trying to verify the report. I’d
say it looks the goods.”</p>

<p>Quintell chuckled, but his eyes were smoldering
venomously. “Who started the rumor—got any
idea?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Quintell, but we do not divulge
our sources of information,” said the other.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly—certainly. Beg pardon. I should
have known better. I assume you’re the new
editor?”</p>

<p>“Yes—Babcock. I have heard a lot about you,
Mr. Quintell, and hope to have the pleasure of
meeting you——”</p>

<p>“The pleasure will be mutual, Mr. Babcock,” said
Quintell significantly, as he hung up.</p>

<p>For some moments the boss of Geerusalem sat
motionless, his gaze riveted on that prominently
displayed first-page story which he and his confederates
had guarded so carefully for weeks past
against circulation, while they bided their time
until Lemuel Huntington should return to the solitude
of his ranch and, under the influence of their
power, be forced to part with his holdings. Quintell
knew positively that whoever tipped the story
off to the <i>Searchlight’s</i> new management was well
aware that the strike was on Huntington’s land.
An attempt to verify the rumor would result, Quintell
was certain, in the location of the bonanza
and all the details appearing, possibly in the very
next issue of this paper over which he and his
gang had, with mysterious suddenness, lost all control.
Huntington would see the account, public attention
would be focused on the Huntington ranch,
and Quintell &amp; Co. would have to pay a fancy
price if they hoped to acquire the property.</p>

<p>Following a short interval of black reflection,
Quintell sprang out of his chair and stormed about
his office. Harrison stood, toying nervously with a
pencil, watching his master.</p>

<p>“McQuaid sold us out—the rat!” roared the
broker. “He had the details. He got his price
and crossed us, the cur! Jumped out of camp
before we could——”</p>

<p>“He may not have, sir,” interrupted the secretary
suavely. “McQuaid never impressed me as being
that type.”</p>

<p>“No? Who, then? Who, then? These prospectors,
who have no legal rights? What a chance!”</p>

<p>“You forget, Mr. Quintell, that Dick Lennox also
knew, and he evaded capture.”</p>

<p>The other stopped in his furious pacing and
wheeled, fastening his penetrating black eyes on
Harrison. He started to speak, then changed his
mind. His lips parted in a cold, triumphant smile.</p>

<p>“If Lennox is still in the country I’ll know it
in half an hour,” he said at last. “Wherever he
is, I’ll know. I should have thought of this before—fool,
that I am!” He strode over to his desk,
picked up the unsigned note he had written, and
handed it to the secretary. “Here, wire this to
Sheriff Warburton, at the county seat! See that
it can’t be traced back to us. Get Rankin up here
as soon as you can. This cocky new editor will
never print the verification of that story, Harrison.
You can gamble on that! And listen: Don’t forget
that little job you have at the Lucky Boy to-night.
I’m driving out to Huntington’s around
eight and I’ll be coming away from there not later
than nine thirty. If you’ll wait for me I’ll pick
you up on my way in. We’re putting over these
two propositions, Harrison—possession of the new
strike claims and sale of the Lucky Boy group—if
we have to go to hell to do it.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you, sir,” said the other
as he left the room.</p>

<p>True to his boast, half an hour afterward—following
a brief talk with the town constable over
the telephone—Quintell got proof that Lennox was
in hiding in the district. The official reported in
person to say that, as the broker had suggested,
he had gone to the post office and, representing that
Lennox was being investigated in connection with
a felony charge and that he wished to ascertain the
fellow’s whereabouts, had learned from the postmaster
that the mining engineer’s mail had been
turned over to Lex Sangerly that very afternoon,
on presentation by the latter of a written request
signed by Lennox.</p>

<p>Since Sangerly had told him that he was staying
at the Huntington ranch, Quintell decided that it
was the logical place to look for the man who had
betrayed the confidence of the gang.</p>

<h2 title='XVII—One Silent Night' id='chXVII'>
  CHAPTER XVII—ONE SILENT NIGHT
</h2>

<p>On the evening that Sheriff Warburton left Tinnemaha
Pete slumbering beside the camp fire
at Blue Mud Spring and rode off for the Huntington
ranch, Lemuel prepared supper early for himself
and Lennox in order that he might have as
much time as possible to devote to the laborious
task of writing Dot a letter.</p>

<p>In a large pantry off the kitchen, which prior
to Lennox’s coming had served as a storeroom, the
mining engineer lay on a cot, helpless; his broken
leg was mending as rapidly as could be expected,
according to the doctor who had made his clandestine
visits under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>Around sundown, Lex Sangerly had returned
from Geerusalem, following his talk with Quintell,
and stopping long enough to leave the mail, motored
away to the railroad construction camp, thirty miles
distant, declaring he would not be back until late.</p>

<p>So, after he had washed the dishes, Lemuel began
elaborate preparations, calculated to usher in becomingly
his penmanship ordeal. He trimmed the
tall kitchen-table lamp, polished its chimney carefully,
got out a writing tablet, envelope, pen and
ink, filled and lighted his pipe, rolled up his sleeves,
and finally squared himself firmly before the table
and started, after a long interval of painful reflection.</p>

<p>He had so much to tell Dot. He must notify
her that Lex was making the ranch his headquarters;
that Dick Lennox was there also, after nearly
having been killed by the Quintell gang; that the
Geerusalem branch of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern
was due to pass in front of the ranch-house door;
that he had sold four tons of alfalfa; that her pet
cow, Bess, was a proud mother, and that he had
collected forty-three eggs that day.</p>

<p>After considerable feinting with the pen, he got
under way. It was a warm, quiet night. The
pen scratched and scratched hesitatingly. The patient
old clock on the wall tick-ticked on and on
tirelessly. A contented bullfrog out in the cool
garden began a hoarse pæan, a dedication to the
silence, and broke off midway in a measure.
Lemuel finished his second page, then sat back and
fired his pipe. With a critical eye, he read what
he had written:</p>

<blockquote>
    <div class='tar'><span class='sc'>Geerusalem</span>, Aug. 29.</div>
    <p><span class='sc'>My own deares dorter</span>: I jest got yore welcom leter an
    was orful glad to heer you bin doin so fine in skule. Lex
    Sangerly he tol me all about you givin him the $20,000.
    I allus knowed you was as hones as the day is long, sweethart,
    an I tol him so an he sed you sure was the fines gal
    he ever seen. An I sed they didn make em no better, an I
    was proud of you. You orter herd us. You sure wood
    a-bin stuck on yoreself. But lissen, honey, an I want that
    you should bare in mind that bein yore ol dad Im allus
    lookin out for yore interes. An that is, you gotter fergit
    this Billy Gee galoot. I dont know why he give you that
    money xcept that Sangerly sez it was to help us out. But
    you gotter figger hes a outlaw, an aint no good nohow. So
    help me Moses, if I git another chanct at him I sure will
    drag him off to the calaboose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grinning proudly, Lemuel picked up his pen
again, dipped it in the ink, and started on his
third page. Then he stopped. The kitchen doorknob
was squeaking. He stared at it and saw to
his dismay that it was moving. Some hand was
trying it. His heart quickened suddenly. He remembered
that he had not turned the key!</p>

<p>It was some distance to the door; but his rifle
stood in the corner, just out of reach. He slid
cautiously out of his chair to get the weapon. At
that very moment, however, the door had opened
and closed, and a man stood in the room, his six-shooter
covering Lemuel.</p>

<p>“Pull down the shades, Huntington! Git a hustle
on you!” the intruder commanded quietly, as he
locked the door.</p>

<p>The rancher gazed at him, horror growing in his
eyes. His visitor was Billy Gee! Arrived at last
was the hour he had so long dreaded, though he
had believed it indefinitely postponed; for he had
been certain the outlaw would hesitate to make an
overt move against him while Lennox and Sangerly
were there. But his Nemesis had come, and now
Lemuel vividly recalled the fellow’s dire threat,
made on that eventful morning in Warburton’s room
in Geerusalem. He grew faint with terror and,
trembling violently, lost no time in obeying the
other’s order.</p>

<p>“Now, sit down!” directed Billy Gee. He waited
until Lemuel slumped weakly into his seat, then
he drew up a chair to the opposite side of the
table, holstered his gun and, his eyes never leaving
the rancher’s face, got out the makings and flipped
a cigarette together.</p>

<p>Lemuel watched him in fearful fascination, trying
to fathom his intentions, hoping in vain that by
some means, Lennox, helpless though he was in the
grip of the plaster cast, might rescue him from
his awful predicament. After a moment, it began
to dawn on him that Billy Gee was not displaying
those evidences of rage and hatred that he felt
certain should forecast revenge. In fact, he thought
the outlaw seemed friendly, notwithstanding the
steely glitter in his eyes. At any rate, he told himself,
the fellow looked well-fed, well-groomed, handsome
indeed, compared to that wan, hollow-eyed,
half-dead wretch he had delivered to Bob Warburton
on that never-to-be-forgotten morning.</p>

<p>“What’re you shakin’ about?” asked Billy Gee
presently. “I had an idea you was gritty, the way
you acted that time you herded me into camp.”
He showed his even teeth in a hard grin. “I
promised I’d make you pay, Huntington. You remember
that? I ain’t forgot it, but I ain’t ready
yet. I jest dropped in to have a quiet leetle chat
with you. I see Lex Sangerly is stoppin’ here with
you, an’ the minin’ engineer, Lennox. How’s he
gettin’ along?”</p>

<p>“He—what d’you want? I’m busy. I’m—I’m
writin’,” burst out Lemuel nervously.</p>

<p>“I hear Miss Dot is doin’ fine at the university,”
said the other, with a glance at the letter. “I wish
you’d give her my best reegards. You sure got a
lady for a daughter, Huntington, an’ it ain’t from
yore side of the fam’ly either.”</p>

<p>A short, painful silence fell. Billy Gee’s glance
wandered to the storeroom where Lennox lay.</p>

<p>“Grab the lamp! I want to see how he’s makin’
out,” he said, rising to his feet as he spoke.</p>

<p>Preceded by Lemuel bearing the light, he crossed
the kitchen and entered the little room. Halting
beside the cot he smiled down at its occupant.</p>

<p>“Hello, pard! How’re you feelin’?”</p>

<p>Lennox regarded him curiously a moment, then
grinned. “You’re the man who saved my life,
aren’t you? I’m feeling better than I did that
night. My leg is knitting, but it’s hell lying here.”</p>

<p>“It sure must be. I reckon you’ll come out all
right, though. Say, I’d lay poorty low if I was
you! The Quintell bunch’s after you, red hot.”</p>

<p>“But why?” argued Lennox. “I’m not in Geerusalem.
They’ve run me out. I’ve quit.”</p>

<p>Billy Gee nodded. “That’s jest it. They’re skeert
you’ll talk. You know too much about their leetle
game. I got the straight tip. They’re set on gettin’
you.”</p>

<p>Alarm crept into the other’s face. “And I’m
flat on my back, unable to protect myself. That’s
certainly cheerful news.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, I couldn’t give you nothin’ better,” said
Billy Gee simply. Some moments later he turned
to leave the room. “Me and Huntington’s got business
together if you’ll excuse us. Hope you’ll come
out all right.”</p>

<p>Once back in the kitchen, the table between
them, the outlaw studied Lemuel speculatively for
a few seconds.</p>

<p>“What did them two railroad detectives do the
night I rambled off in their automobile? Sorter
jolted ’em, didn’t it?” he asked finally.</p>

<p>“They didn’t do nothin’. They was sore, of
course, an’ started quarrelin’ among themselves. I
s’pose you knowed they left here to-day?” Lemuel
paused and added: “I—I oughter mebby thank
you for doin’ me a favor. They was goin’ to
arrest me.”</p>

<p>Billy Gee laughed softly. “I heerd ’em gabbin’
about it. Miss Dot turned the money back to
Lex Sangerly, didn’t she? I’m glad she did—now.”
He shifted in his chair, placed his elbows
on the table, and covered the rancher with an intense
look. “I come to ask a favor off o’ you,
Huntington. It ain’t a favor either. You owe it to
me. I give you yore start, so to speak. You made
ten thousand dollars off o’ me—sold me like you
would one of yore cows. I’ll never forget that.
You’re goin’ to pay heavy for it some o’ these
days. See if you don’t! Right now I’m askin’
what’s part mine, savvy? I want you to give
Tinnemaha Pete a deed o’ gift to that hill on
the far end of the ranch.”</p>

<p>Lemuel sat bolt upright, then a hoarse exclamation
burst from him. He paled through his sunburn.
“Good Lord, man! You don’t aim to take
the leetle I got?” he choked.</p>

<p>“If that hill was bringin’ you in anythin’, I
wouldn’t ask it, Huntington—bad as I’d like to
hurt you,” said Billy Gee evenly. “But it ain’t.
A steer’d starve to death for the grass that’s on it,
and you know it. Tinnemaha is lookin’ to do some
prospectin’ an’ he don’t figger to deevelop another
man’s property. He’ll be here to see you to-morrow
or nex’ day. An’ you see that you give
him a deed, see, or—well, I’ll be back, you kin
gamble on that!”</p>

<p>“But can’t you see, I got two full quarter sections,
an’ cuttin’ off that strip’ll ruin ’em?” cried
Lemuel, in desperation. “An’ there’s my poor, leetle
gal tryin’ to git a edjucation, an’——”</p>

<p>“Miss Dot’ll manage fine an’ dandy, I reckon,”
asserted the bandit. “I hear she’s livin’ with Mrs.
Liggs, an’ I don’t know of a better woman in the
world than her. Mind what I’m a-tellin’ you,
Huntington! You give ol’ Tinnemaha Pete a quit-claim
title to that there hill, an’ don’t lose no time
doin’ it. D’you understand? I’m goin’ to keep
cases on you, an’ if I find out you ain’t done it,
God help you!”</p>

<p>He broke off short and flapped his hat suddenly
at the lamp, plunging the kitchen in darkness.
His trained ear had caught a sound outside the
house. The next instant he had flitted around the
table and was standing over Lemuel.</p>

<p>“Don’t move! Don’t answer, no matter what!”
he whispered into the rancher’s ear.</p>

<p>Approaching from the direction of Geerusalem,
now came the gentle purring of an automobile.
Lemuel in the grip of mixed emotions waited breathlessly.
He waited for Billy Gee to speak. He
was not sure where the outlaw was. He strained
his ears through the darkness, listening. The machine
came to a stop before the ranch. That could
not be Sangerly, he knew. Who then? Ah, the
doctor!</p>

<p>“You’d better git outside if you’re goin’ to do any
shootin’,” Lemuel said in subdued tones, addressing
the gloom. “That’s Doc Porter comin’ to see Lennox.
Don’t go to killin’ him.”</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>Heavy footfalls sounded on the kitchen porch.
They stopped and went suddenly blundering down
the back steps and on through the garden, bound
for the front of the house. A revolver began roaring
savagely; a strident voice boomed on the night,
commanding a halt. Lemuel reached out a cautious
hand for the outlaw, feeling for him, but found
he was no longer standing beside him. He sprang
to his feet, then caught up his rifle out of the
corner, and groped his way toward the front door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Huntington, what was that? Is that them
after me? Huntington, are you——&#160;Give me a
gun, man! Don’t let me die like a rat,” cried Lennox
wildly, his voice ringing through the house.</p>

<p>“Rat, be damned!” called back Lemuel. “It’s the
bandit friend of yourn I’m after. The skunk!
Here’s where he gits what’s a-comin’ to him.”</p>

<p>He charged along the dark hall and got to the
front door. It stood wide open. Billy Gee had
fled. Halting undecidedly on the threshold, his
rifle held ready, Lemuel glared about. The automobile
stood at the gate, its headlights blazing.
He heard the man of the heavy footfalls plunging
down the gravel walk, then his harsh, authoritative
tones.</p>

<p>“Stick up yore hands, in the name of the law!
Up with ’em, I said, or I’ll blow you to kingdom
come!” A dramatic pause, then: “Now march
over to the house! Thought you could visit round
free an’ easy, eh? Well, yore visitin’ days is
about over, sport. Git a hustle on you!”</p>

<p>“This is an outrage, officer. You’ve got the
wrong man,” protested the prisoner indignantly.</p>

<p>“Yeh? Well, we’ll see about that. You put it
over pretty on the train, kid, but you ain’t never
doin’ it ag’in, let me tell you. If you don’t shet
yore face, I will. Hey, Lem! Make a light in
there. This is Bob Warburton.”</p>

<p>The sheriff, following the clew given him by Tinnemaha
Pete—that Billy Gee was at the Huntington
ranch—had ridden direct from Blue Mud Spring.
Creeping onto the kitchen porch, he had heard the
outlaw and Lemuel talking. He had seen the light
suddenly extinguished, and had heard the approaching
machine. Racing around the house, he had
caught sight of a man dodging into the gloom of
the garden shrubbery and had apprehended him.</p>

<p>Now, at the sheriff’s words, Lemuel hurried back
into the kitchen and lit the lamp. Presently Warburton
appeared herding his captive unceremoniously
before him. Lemuel stared blankly at the
latter, and the official, giving him one look, burst
into a torrent of curses. His prisoner was Jule
Quintell, pale, unnerved, but furious over the rough
reception he had received.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this rather cheap comedy for the sheriff
of San Buenaventura County to pull?” sneered the
broker. His attitude was one of contempt and defiance.</p>

<p>The sheriff, in the act of hurrying out to make
a search of the premises, wheeled, flushing with
rage. “Say that ag’in, mister!” He spoke in a
voice that Lemuel, in the many years he had known
him, had never heard him use before.</p>

<p>“I’m Jule Quintell, of Geerusalem, Sheriff Warburton.
I protest emphatically against this sort of
treatment,” began the man, assuming an air of
resentful dignity.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are! Well, let me tell you somepn,
Quintell: You jest make another crack like that,
an’ see what happens. I’ve heerd you’re the big
I-am over in these parts,” continued Warburton,
glowering at the other. “An’ they tell me you got
all kinds of pull. But don’t you ever git in my
way, Quintell. D’you understand?”</p>

<p>The broker extracted a cigarette from his dainty
gold case. “That’s more of an order than a threat,
isn’t it, sheriff?” he asked coolly.</p>

<p>“You can find that out for yoreself,” retorted
Warburton.</p>

<p>Quintell chuckled. “Very well, sheriff. Should
the opportunity ever present itself, I most certainly
will make the test. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d
like to take up a small business matter with Mr.
Huntington here.” He turned toward Lemuel.
“And how have you been, Lem? I hear that Billy
Gee is at large again. How unfortunate—after
you went to all the trouble and danger of capturing
him!”</p>

<p>Warburton’s face flamed under the thrust. He
opened his mouth to speak, then closed it hard
over his set teeth. Turning on his heel, he walked
out of the kitchen, gripping his six-shooter in a
hand that shook with rage.</p>

<h2 title='XVIII—Skulking Shadows' id='chXVIII'>
  CHAPTER XVIII—SKULKING SHADOWS
</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, Billy Gee had reached his horse
tethered conveniently near by and struck out
across the plains. It was still early evening, the
sky thick-strewn with brilliant stars. He rode
along for a short distance, then stopped and listened
for sounds of pursuit. He waited for some time
and, convincing himself that Sheriff Warburton had
not believed a night pursuit worth while, set his
course for Geerusalem. From the distant camp
came the thunder of stamp mills grinding loose
the yellow treasure from the clinging pulp. A
foraging coyote, miles off, yelped dismally.</p>

<p>As he galloped on, Billy Gee laughed. Again he
had outwitted the doughty sheriff of San Buenaventura
County. There was a reckless pride in the
thought. He felt the spur of hazard over the
achievement—an urge to do something rash for the
mere pleasure of doing it, to make those denizens
of Soapweed Plains sit up and take notice and
marvel at his daringness. It was a consuming, impelling
fascination.</p>

<p>He gazed up at the stars. It was a “large” night
out, he told himself, and he felt fit as a fiddle.
Yes, sir, he would ride into Geerusalem and give
it the once over, before returning to Blue Mud
Spring and the faithful companionship of old Tinnemaha
Pete.</p>

<p>Anyway, he reflected complacently, he had arranged
it so Tinnemaha would get possession of
the bonanza hill. Poor old Tinnemaha, his one
friend, had worked hard, slaved for what he had
found. And they were partners—partners of the
richest ground in the district! In the last two
days they had uncovered a pay chute that the
desertarian vowed was rich beyond the conception
of prospectordom. They would sell the claims outright,
fifty-fifty the money, and leave Soapweed
Plains forever.</p>

<p>There were a lot of fairer and more congenial
climes to which he himself could go. Sheriff Warburton
would never let him alone, would never
stop until he had tracked him down and headed
him for the penitentiary. And yet, he was going
straight now, had been going straight ever since
that wonderful night in the Huntington hayloft,
when Dot had called him a “poor, wounded wild
animal.” Funny how he had needed just that one
little bit of interest from a girl to make him
change. He had promised her and he had made
good, thanks to that grand old wheel horse Tinnemaha
Pete, and that grandest little mother who
stuck to him heroically, though he had blighted her
life with heartaches. He had been such a no-account
cur these last three years.</p>

<p>He reached the road, turned into it, and followed
it, musing. He recalled that his mother had written
him that Dot was working on a novel about Billy
Gee. As he let his mind dwell on the thought, he
felt the blood warm in his veins. His heart beat
faster. Yes, sir, he decided, Dot must surely get
an education—for was not an education necessary
to write books? He was pretty certain it was, considering
it was a painful piece of work for him
to write so common a thing as a letter. And there
must be a girl in that novel. Who was she? Did
Billy Gee come wounded to the ranch, and was he
cared for by the girl friend of his mother? There
was the arrival of that persistent sheriff, Bob Warburton.
And did the wonderful girl hide the
wounded bandit in her room?</p>

<p>From speculating thus, he presently became possessed
with the desire to see Dot. He wanted to
hear her voice again, those musical tones of hers
that he had never forgotten. His being craved
for the pity she poured out to him, her splendid
sympathy for him, her understanding of him. Besides,
he knew he could give her so many interesting
sidelights into Billy Gee’s career, that he was
sure she could use to advantage in her novel. For
instance, how he had risked two trips to San
Francisco to inquire after her; how he had called
on his mother one night, while Dot was asleep,
and confessed his love for the girl; how he had
met his boyhood chum, Lex Sangerly, on the
branch-road line of survey a few days ago, and
conversed with him for half an hour without being
recognized; how he was keeping his promise—going
the straight and narrow for her sake.</p>

<p>The staccato sound of an open muffler in the distance
back of him, interrupted his trend of thought.
He glanced over his shoulder and saw the twin
lights of an automobile coming from the direction
of the Huntington ranch. He was not certain
whose car it was. Sangerly, he knew, had driven
toward Mirage at sundown, for he had been watching
from afar and had seen him go. He believed
that the oncoming car was the one which had
stopped at the ranch while he was making his
escape. Doubtless Warburton, by some means or
another, had discovered the way he went and was
seeking——No, that couldn’t be it. More than
likely, it was Warburton hurrying to camp to organize
a posse. That would be the average sheriff’s
method of working; never single-handed—always
twenty to one, playing safe.</p>

<p>He looked ahead. He had reached the mouth
of Geerusalem Gulch. A mile or so away, a few
scattered lights twinkled, indicating the outskirts
of the settlement. The old rock shack, where he
had rescued Lennox from the Quintell gunmen,
lay within pistol-shot distance. It was a little too
far off to make it unobserved, for it just might
be that the powerful headlights of the approaching
machine would reveal him. He could not afford to
take a chance.</p>

<p>Spurring out of the road, he steered for a thick
patch of brush near by. He brought his horse to
a halt behind it, swung from the saddle, and
waited, screened by the heavy foliage. The machine
came dashing up the road. As it got abreast of
the hiding place, it slowed down, and the headlights
were switched off.</p>

<p>Mystified, Billy Gee crouched low to the ground,
watching the blue-black sky line, and gripped his
revolver. Presently he heard the crunch of gravel
underfoot. He saw the shadowlike figure of a
man pass stealthily over the wash and vanish into
the gloom.</p>

<p>“That you, Mr. Quintell?” suddenly came the low
voice of another man, some distance away.</p>

<p>A curse broke from the newcomer. “You damn
boob! Are you trying to advertise this thing? Come
over here!”</p>

<p>A short pause followed, broken only by the sound
of footsteps blundering over the rocky wash.</p>

<p>Quintell spoke again: “Is it all right? Did you
do exactly as I said—the width of two claims?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But I’m not—I did the best I could
about marking the spots. It’s too dark to see, and
a pile of stones might excite suspicion. I was afraid
to strike matches.”</p>

<p>“Did you use up all the dust? How many spots
are there?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-two. Yes, I used it all. That ought
to be enough for an assay test, I’d imagine—taking
a little from each, you understand. I distributed it
so as to lead one to conclude that the entire gulch
prospects.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see one of the spots,” said Quintell curtly.
“This business has to go through without a hitch.
The slightest hesitation would mean failure. He’d
become suspicious. You’ll have to go about the
job of picking the test gravel naturally. Make it
appear that you’re doing it haphazardly.”</p>

<p>Billy Gee heard them moving about, and curious
to ascertain more concerning what he knew to be
a deliberate “salting” of worthless ground for the
purpose of selling it to some tenderfoot, he crept
after them. Soon he had made his way to within
a few yards of them. They were fumbling among
the boulders. The broker growled impatiently and
struck a match. He shielded it with his hands so
that the light flashed downward, showing a diminutive
monument of two rocks, one laid upon the other.
The match went out.</p>

<p>“That’ll do fine,” muttered Quintell. “They’re all
like that, are they? Now, as I said, Harrison,
you’re to take charge of the samples. I might not
be able to get word to you to-morrow. Follow
the right of way, as near as possible. That’ll
be the first test. The other can be taken from
any part of the gulch. I’m not dead sure of this
fellow, see? I found out this afternoon that he’s
been making inquiries about Jerome Liggs. It may
be that he’s wise to the strike and that he’s after
the Huntington ranch, as a side issue. Just because
he’s a railroad man, don’t mean that he’d pass up
a bonanza, by any means.”</p>

<p>“You saw Huntington, of course?” said Harrison.
“I dare say you had matters all your own way?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did not—damn him! He laughed at
me. I offered him ten thousand for his brush
ranch—think of that!—and he fussed and giggled,
and ended finally by telling me that his daughter
and he had agreed not to sell. I’ve seen the time
when the old devil would have sold his soul for a
copper penny, if he could have jammed his girl
through college. He’s got a few beans, to-day, and—by
the way, Harrison, she’s a fancy skirt, and I
hear she’s writing a novel with your Uncle Dudley
as one of the characters. Believe me, I’m dropping
in on her the very next trip to Frisco! Nothing
like evincing interest, you know.</p>

<p>“At that, I might have put the screws to Huntington
and forced the sale, if it hadn’t been for
Sheriff Warburton. He was there, the big bonehead.
He rambled in while I sat there, check
book in hand, and eyed me like something the cat
dragged in. He hates me for fair. Let’s get to
camp. I’m starting the boys after Huntington. I’ve
given him his chance. Now he takes what he gets.”</p>

<p>Billy Gee, listening, heard the two men moving
off toward the car, and followed them cautiously
through the darkness.</p>

<p>“The proper thing, sir,” agreed Harrison. “By
the way, did you ascertain if Lennox is stopping
there?”</p>

<p>“I’m not certain. That will be for Rankin to
find out. But here’s the situation, so far as Warburton
and Huntington are concerned: As I was
going into the ranch, Billy Gee, the bandit—he’s
back in the country—was coming out. I don’t
know what he was doing—talking to Huntington, I
imagine. Warburton was snooping around the
house after him and nailed me instead of him.
The point is, we’ll circulate the news that Billy
Gee was staying at the ranch—hiding out, you
understand. In other words, we’ll frame Huntington,
make him out the outlaw’s friend, and the
long hairs of the camp won’t make a cheep at the
action of a vigilance committee. If we work it
smoothly, we’ll have them with us. Here comes a
machine. Quick! Run! Follow me!”</p>

<p>Speeding down the road from the direction of
the settlement, the lights of an automobile appeared,
visible now and again over the boulders and clumps
of brush. Quintell and his secretary dashed for
their car, sprang in, and went careening off for
camp. Billy Gee stood and watched the two machines
whirl by each other. He stood in the grip
of conflicting emotions. The broker’s insulting
reference to Dot had been sufficient in itself to
whip him into a murderous fury, but the very
urge he had felt to kill the fellow on the spot
had been restrained by an overwhelming discovery
which he had made a moment before.</p>

<p>Just now, he gazed vaguely through the night
after the tail light disappearing in the gloom of
Geerusalem Gulch. Presently he tore his eyes
away from it to look at the other machine. It
was approaching at moderate speed, bouncing and
swaying over the rough road. Of a sudden, as it
went bowling past him, a girl’s silvery laughter
smote his ears. The sound electrified him. He
caught his breath, and his body stiffened like
steel. He thought he could make out the forms
of two women in the rear seat; the man driving
wore the regulation chauffeur’s cap.</p>

<p>The machine whirled on, and for many minutes
he stared after it, until it was swallowed up in
the darkness toward the Huntington ranch. He
roused himself finally. It must be <i>she</i>, and that was
his mother with her. But why had they come? His
heart began singing within him. He threw back
his head and smiled up at the stars. It was a
“large” night out, sure enough; but there was
nothing in Geerusalem to attract him.</p>

<p>Then his mind turned to what he had just
overheard between Quintell and Harrison, and a
low whistle broke from him as he realized the vast
importance of the information he possessed. “This
powerful rogue, Jule Quintell, was preparing to
sell salted ground to the Mohave &amp; Southwestern
Railroad Company. To rob that company—not
openly as he had done—but stealthily, perfidiously,
under the guise of fair dealing. To-night, Quintell
proposed to crush Huntington too, to drive Dot’s
father out of the country—probably kill him, as
had been done to others. He wanted the Billy
Geerusalem claims, did he? So, Mister Quintell
believed it would be as easy as all that—simply
a matter of taking over the ranch and ousting
Tinnemaha Pete and himself? After they had
found this big bonanza, Quintell intended grabbing
it, eh?”</p>

<p>He walked over to his horse presently and
mounted. He was chuckling harshly. He held
Jule Quintell in the hollow of his hand. The
one menace now was Sheriff Warburton. Yes,
Warburton was a menace, but there was a way of
winning him over, the only way. He turned his
horse about and went spurring off through the
darkness for Blue Mud Spring.</p>

<p>That voice! That face he had glimpsed by the
light of the match!</p>

<p>“It’s a large night out, believe me!” he muttered
grimly.</p>

<h2 title='XIX—An Enemy in the Ranks' id='chXIX'>
  CHAPTER XIX—AN ENEMY IN THE RANKS
</h2>

<p>This particular August evening was destined to
be the most eventful one in Lemuel Huntington’s
life, for hardly had he recovered from the
shock occasioned by Billy Gee’s visit, ere he received
a glorious surprise—Dot’s unannounced arrival
from San Francisco. She came bounding into the
house, followed by Mrs. Liggs, caught her astonished
father in an ecstatic embrace, stifled his
ejaculations with kisses, and told him breathlessly
the reason for her return home. Even Warburton,
scowling and furious over the outlaw’s escape,
came in for his share of Dot’s effusiveness and
forgot for the time the responsibilities of his office.</p>

<p>It appeared that Mrs. Liggs having received a letter
from Tinnemaha Pete, containing the disturbing
news that Sheriff Warburton was again in the
neighborhood, presumably searching for her son,
that loyal little mother after consulting with Dot
decided on returning to Soapweed Plains and, regardless
of Billy Gee’s intentions to see that his
old friend obtained ultimate possession of the new
gold strike, try to persuade him to leave the country
and take up his residence with her in the metropolis.
Since the trip would not occupy longer
than a week, Dot had made up her mind to go
along—so Mrs. Liggs would not be lonesome, she
had said. Though the truth was, she felt a consuming
desire to meet and talk again with this
romantic hero of her girlish dreams, to see how
he looked and acted in the full flush of health,
to find out if he had forgotten that tragic day
of his advent at the ranch. She was curious to
know how he would treat her, what he would say
to her, and she secretly told herself that, once
having met him, she could bring back with her
certain happy memories which would do much to
make her studies at the university more apparently
worth while. Besides, there was the novel she
was writing around this knight of Soapweed Plains,
without knowing just exactly his character.</p>

<p>But Dot said nothing of all this to her father.
According to the agreement she made with Mrs.
Liggs, the girl simply told Lemuel that the little
old lady had some important business to transact
in Geerusalem, and that she, Dot, had taken advantage
of the opportunity to pay a visit home. She
went on to say that Lemuel must accompany them
back to San Francisco. He must see the adorable
bungalow where she and Mrs. Liggs lived. Then
he would have to spend a day at the University
of California, and—— Oh, he must hear what she
had written on her novel!</p>

<p>She talked on breathlessly, recounting her adventures,
plying him with questions. Lemuel listened,
open-mouthed, replying vaguely, his eyes
brilliant with admiration. She looked queenly and
so thoroughly refined, he thought, and she was
prettier and far more vivacious than he had ever
seen her before.</p>

<p>Once he leaned over and whispered into Sheriff
Warburton’s ear: “Bob, you notice them big words
she’s slingin’? Hear ’em? That’s one of ’em—conspicuously.
That’s what edjucation does. Listen
to that, will you! Rattles ’em off, like nuthin’.”</p>

<p>It was an epochal homecoming. Until after midnight,
Dot regaled them with incidents and painted
glowing pictures of San Francisco for them. Around
one o’clock, Sheriff Warburton suddenly recalled
that the unexpected arrival of the two women robbed
him of his chances of a bed for the night.</p>

<p>Reluctantly he struck out for his own blankets
at Blue Mud Spring, getting a little comfort out
of the thought that, although Billy Gee had eluded
him, he would be able to grill Tinnemaha Pete
on the habits and the probable whereabouts of the
bandit the first thing in the morning. None the
less gratifying was the fact that Mrs. Liggs was
back in the district, where he could reach her
when he needed her. Why had she returned, he
wondered? Unquestionably, her presence had to
do with Billy Gee. But what? Well, no matter.
He’d force it out of Tinnemaha Pete. The old
fellow would give him a straightforward story, or
go to jail. Too bad, but he, Warburton, had to
do his duty.</p>

<p>However, when Sheriff Warburton reached Blue
Mud Spring, the camp fire was ashes, stone cold,
and Tinnemaha Pete and his pair of burros were
gone. Warburton looked back undecidedly through
the gloom of the cool desert night in the direction
of the Huntington ranch. After an interval, he
dismounted, unsaddled his mule, spread out his
blankets on the ground, and turned in, cursing.
Billy Gee had outwitted him a second time. The
third time was a charm, he told himself as he
dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p class='mt10'>Lex Sangerly, however, was not so fortunate as
Warburton. He could not compose himself to rest.
Shortly after the sheriff left the ranch, he had
driven in from his trip to the railroad construction
camp and found Lemuel waiting up for him, entertaining
Lennox with a detailed account of Billy
Gee’s career of crime. After relating to Lex the
stirring events of the night, including the unannounced
arrival of Dot and Mrs. Liggs, the rancher
concluded with a dissertation on the virtues of education
as manifested by the ease with which his
daughter handled words, that he proudly declared
were “jaw-breakers” of an unusual type.</p>

<p>Just now, Lex lay in Lemuel’s bed and tossed
about nervously in the grip of disturbing thoughts.
From the parlor lounge across the hall came sonorous
evidence of Huntington’s blissful state of mind,
rumbling rhythmically through the house. The
night was tomblike.</p>

<p>Lex rehearsed again and again the talk he had
had that afternoon with Jule Quintell, and on the
heels of this there paraded before his mind’s eye
the damaging information he had gathered against
the broker from confidential sources in Geerusalem.
These had substantiated all that he had heard
heretofore, and briefly, went to describe Quintell
as a tricky, unscrupulous wildcatter, associated with
a coterie of other like gentry, polished crooks all,
whose sole aim was to fleece the unwary, and
who exercised their power in camp by their manipulation
of the ruthless “stingaree” element and control
of the civil authorities.</p>

<p>This meant to Lex nothing less than that Quintell
and his placer-claim partners were banded together
to make the Mohave &amp; Southwestern Company pay
heavily for the privilege of laying its tracks across
their ground. In other words, the broker’s reference
to fabulous gold-bearing gravel existing in
Geerusalem Gulch was true, but owing to the fact
only that the ground had been salted to show the
existence of gold. He had heard of many cases
where worthless mines had been sold by the employment
of such tactics. Why not in this instance?
He was suspicious of the whole matter, and had
there been another likely approach into the camp,
he would have urged abandonment of the gulch
route. But there was not.</p>

<p>The Quintell forces held the gates of Geerusalem,
as it were. Though his surmise might be correct
that they were faking their representations to make
his company meet their demands, how could he
prove it? How could he find out that they had
salted those claims? They had doubtless done it
cunningly, secretly, for proof of such an act laid
them liable to arrest and prosecution.</p>

<p>Complicating the situation still more was the
telegram he had received that same day from his
father, directing that negotiations with Quintell
be hastened, and details as to terms wired at the
earliest possible moment. Quite the contrary, it
seemed as if the broker was sparring for time. He
had stated that the valuation of the ground to be
covered by the right of way must be determined
by the content of gold per cubic yard of gravel
occupied by the roadbed. This meant assaying
the gulch, and assaying took time. And it followed
that the richer the ground, the greater would
be the price demanded. Lex sensed the scheme
and writhed at the realization that he was powerless
to frustrate it. The mining laws of California
favored the owner who could show mineral in
paying quantities.</p>

<p>His gloomy reflections were startlingly interrupted
by a violent pounding on the front door. Of a
sudden, the silent night roared out with a bedlam
of men’s voices. From the rear of the house
came the crack of a revolver, the crash of glass
from one of the kitchen windows, Lennox’s terrified
cry.</p>

<p>Lex sprang out of bed, pulled a curtain aside,
and peered into the darkness. The porch was
jammed with men. He could hear the hurried
tramp of boots on the driveway leading to the
barn, the blows of an ax wielded on the barn
door, breaking its padlock. The pounding at the
front of the house was resumed, accompanied by
kicks.</p>

<p>“Huntington, open up or we’ll bust her in!”
shouted a man, with an oath.</p>

<p>Lex groped about for matches and lighted a lamp.
“Hold on there a minute!” he yelled back. He
began hurrying into his clothes. A strange nervousness
seized him. Vigilantes—a mob—had crept up
and surrounded the place. They had come to exact
some tribute, to wreak vengeance, to enforce summary
justice. Which, and on whom? He heard
Dot’s voice in the hall, vibrant and fearless.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Bust down the door!” chorused the crowd.</p>

<p>“We want the man who’s been befriending Billy
Gee,” cried the first speaker. “Are you opening
this door or do we break it in?”</p>

<p>At this juncture Lex stepped into the hall. Lemuel
stood half dressed, pale with fright, holding
a candle in one trembling hand. Dot, clad in a
dressing gown, her thick, wavy hair tumbled charmingly
over her shoulders, her eyes glinting with a
strange fire, was standing before the door, firmly
gripping a six-shooter. Huddled up against the
wall, some distance back, was Mrs. Liggs wringing
her thin hands distractedly.</p>

<p>“The man who tries to come in here, dies! Do
you understand that?” called out the girl in harsh
tones.</p>

<p>A wild jeer went up. The mob howled for action,
and heavy shoulders started heaving against the
panels. Dot fired. The bullet tore through the
lintel, whined spitefully over the heads of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Atta boy! Now, altogether! Get the back door,
Shorty!” bellowed the leader.</p>

<p>The front door bulged and creaked under a second
attack, and again Dot fired. A howl of rage broke
from one of the men. There was a mad scramble
out of range.</p>

<p>“Smoke ’em out! Smoke ’em out!” rose the
furious cry.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! They’re goin’ to burn down the
house,” wailed Lemuel hysterically.</p>

<p>“Say, men!” shouted Lex. “There’s some mistake.
This is Sangerly of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern
speaking. I’ll vouch for Mr. Huntington.
He’s never had any friendly relations with this
outlaw——”</p>

<p>“Is that so, Sangerly?” sneered the leader of
the mob. “Well, you’re not such a wise guy as
you think you are. Huntington was entertaining
Billy Gee here this evening. He’s been hanging
out at this ranch right along. Say, Huntington,
are you delivering yourself up, or do we burn
you out?”</p>

<p>Lennox, listening fearfully from his cot in the
little room off the kitchen, recognized the speaker
as Big George Rankin, czar of Geerusalem’s underworld.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s ridiculous,” cried Lex. “Mr. Huntington
captured Billy Gee and turned him over to
the authorities——”</p>

<p>The roar of voices which had ceased during the
brief parley, rose again now, violent and menacing.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie! It’s a lie! I ain’t bin friends with
the measly skunk,” moaned Lemuel. Mrs. Liggs
was staring at him, in a dumb, bewildered way.</p>

<p>Dot still watched the door. Her eyes were glittering
dangerously, her whole manner betokening
cool, desperate determination. Lex, unused to frontier
crises of this kind, had left his revolver in
his room. He now ran in to get it and found
that the men on the porch were trying the windows.
He had barely discovered this fact, when a revolver
ripped suddenly down through the panes, showering
him with glass. At the same instant, he heard the
kitchen door fall in with a crash. Rushing back
into the hall, he was just in time to come under
a bristling array of leveled guns in the hands of
bandanna-masked men, trained on the Huntington
household.</p>

<p>In a trice, Dot was disarmed and Lemuel hurled
into his room to dress. The place was quickly
overrun by the mob, rummaging and ransacking
bureaus, closets, trunks. Even the cupboard was
swept clean. To Lex, it seemed as if they went
about their work with a thoroughness that was
almost painstakingly vicious. It was as if they
were following out some plan to render the house
untenantable, to strip its owner of his belongings.</p>

<p>Rankin, big and burly, his cruel eyes fiery over
his red mask, stopped before Dot.</p>

<p>“You be on your way out of the country before
morning, kid! Get me?” he growled. “And take
this old dame along with you,” indicating the half-fainting
Mrs. Liggs whom the girl held in her arms.
“Get out and stay out!” He turned to Lex. “As
for you, Mr. Sangerly, you’ve got a room in the
Miners’ Hotel. See that you occupy it, if you’re
not looking for a coat of tar. Outside, gang, and
clean up the works!”</p>

<p>The majority of the mob went trooping away in
obedience to the command, and presently Lex heard
sounds which proclaimed the destruction of the outbuildings,
coupled with the frantic clamor of the
occupants of coop and sty.</p>

<p>A man hurried in from the kitchen and beckoned
Rankin to one side. “Lennox’s layin’ in there with
a busted leg,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Hell he is! Well, you know your orders, Shorty.
Bump him off, but wait till we leave, see? Tell
Logan to help you. Make a good job of it.”</p>

<p>A number of men dragged Lemuel from his room.
He was in a state of collapse. Dot relinquished
Mrs. Liggs to Lex, and rushing forward, threw
her arms around her father’s neck, begging, pleading
hysterically with Rankin, to no purpose. Sangerly
began an impassioned appeal also, and received
a brutal blow in the face for his interference.</p>

<p>Out through the front door they hustled Lemuel.
They bundled him on a horse and set a guard over
him, while Rankin rounded up his gang preparatory
to departing. At last, with a parting six-shooter
volley into the air and a chorus of wild shouts,
the mob spurred away. The first faint shafts of
light were beginning to silver the eastern sky.
Soapweed Plains had never seemed so tragically
silent, so filled with woe and frightful foreboding.</p>

<p>Out on the front porch, Lex stood holding Mrs.
Liggs. The little old lady was moaning pitifully,
clutching Dot’s hand in her own trembling one.
The girl was, for the moment, stricken dumb by the
suddenness of it all—the destruction of the ranch,
the bold abduction of her father, horror over his
possible fate at the hands of that lawless crowd.
Then she roused herself and darted into the house.
The next instant she reappeared, hatted and cloaked,
and sped down the steps and along the walk leading
to the rear of the premises. Alarmed at her action,
Lex helped Mrs. Liggs to a porch chair and hurried
after her. He overtook her as she was scrambling
through the wire fence into the field.</p>

<p>“Miss Huntington, where are you going?” he
panted.</p>

<p>“I’m following them. Please help me catch a
horse!” she cried wildly. “Oh, the beasts! The
beasts! They’re——” She broke off and listened
frantically into the night. “Hear them? They’re
taking him toward camp, but there is a trail branching
off. They’re going that way. I heard one of
them say they intend to set him afoot in Lone
Mountain Pass. He’ll die out there. Quick! Mr.
Sangerly, I——”</p>

<p>“My car,” he burst out. “If they haven’t destroyed
it—tampered with it.” He grasped her arm,
and together they raced for the roadster standing
to one side of the driveway. “But we ought to
run into camp and report the matter to the authorities.
We can’t hope to do anything alone, Miss
Huntington. It would be madness to oppose them,”
he argued, as they sprang into the machine.</p>

<p>By a streak of good fortune—which that arch-plotter
Jule Quintell could have easily explained,
considering that he felt confident of putting over
the right of way deal—the night riders had left the
roadster severely alone.</p>

<p>Dot made no reply, and Lex started turning the
roadster around in the wide space of yard. At
this juncture, two shots rang out inside the house,
followed by Mrs. Liggs’ terrified scream from the
front porch. A hoarse cry broke from Lex. He
brought the car to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>“My God—Lennox! I’d forgotten him. They’ve
killed——”</p>

<p>There was a sound of blundering footfalls across
the bare kitchen floor. The next instant, a man
staggered out of the back door, toppled down the
steps, and pitched headlong to the ground, in the
full glare of the headlights. Blood was issuing
from his mouth.</p>

<p>Then, while Dot and Lex gazed horrified at the
prostrate form, a shriveled-up little figure appeared
in the kitchen door, clutching a revolver in one
bony hand. It was Tinnemaha Pete.</p>

<p>“That you, Spangaree?” he cackled excitedly at
the roadster. “Son of a gun! Got ’em both—first
pop. They was goin’ to drill Mr. Lummox, an’
I dropped ’em. Poorty as ye please. First pop.
Son of a gun! Ain’t killed a man afore, either.
That’s one of ’em. First pop, Spangaree. Agatha!
Looket, Agatha——” He went trotting through the
house, calling to Mrs. Liggs.</p>

<p>Dot, staring at the dead man, shivered.</p>

<p>Lex got the roadster under way. It sped out of
the driveway and into the road, gathering speed;
plunging and swaying along, the sand rattling like
machine-gun fire against the under side of the
fenders. The girl, wide-eyed, her face bloodless,
drawn with fear, watched in awful suspense for
sight of the mob.</p>

<p>“We’d better drive to camp, Miss Huntington,
and get out the constable—have him lead a posse
after them. It’s the safest course, all around,”
said Lex presently.</p>

<p>A sob broke from her. “Oh, what terrible thing
are they going to do!” she cried in anguish. “We’ll
have to save him. Can’t you see? We can’t
leave him. It’ll take time to get help. Oh, Mr.
Sangerly——”</p>

<p>“It’s a terrible situation, I know,” he interrupted
gently; “but you must understand that these ruffians
will hesitate at nothing. When they would plan
to murder poor Lennox, lying in bed, unable to
defend himself, what consideration would they
give us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know! I don’t know!” she moaned.
“Perhaps you’re right. I can’t think clearly. Merciful
Father, have pity on——” She broke off,
glaring intently ahead. “There they are! There
they are!”</p>

<p>As she spoke, the galloping mass of the night
riders came into view. The roadster bore down on
it rapidly, and the powerful rays of the headlights
growing brighter and brighter, startled the horses.
Those in the rear began bolting in fright, swerving
sharply, unmanageable for the instant. But that
instant proved sufficient in which to throw the entire
body into confusion. It split, scattering to either
side of the road, and Lex, a cold hand clutching
his heart, steered the car into the breach, stepping
on the gas as he did so.</p>

<p>A deafening roar went up from the cavalcade. A
hail of bullets riddled the radiator. Racing alongside,
several of the riders thrust their six-shooters
down on Lex and the girl, commanding a halt.
Dot got a fleeting glimpse of her father, bareheaded,
his face ashen with terror. He sat astride a horse,
his hands tied behind him. Lex brought the machine
to a stop, and the mob surrounded it.</p>

<p>“Out of that buzz wagon, partner!” cried Big
George Rankin, spurring forward. “It seems to
me you’re itching for that coat of tar I promised
you. You can’t monkey with a law-and-order bunch
in these parts without getting your feet wet. Kid,”
addressing Dot, “you hop out of there, too. I
suppose, Mr. Sangerly, you were on your way to
spread the alarm, eh? Well, we’ll attend to you
before we do anything else. You’re a pretty wise
bird—in Los Angeles,” he added significantly.</p>

<p>The whole troop was by now drawn around the
roadster—a grim company, surely, what with their
grotesque, blood-red handkerchief masks and attitude
of lawless abandon. Lex and Dot stood on
the ground near the roadster. The girl was weeping
audibly, gazing with distracted eyes through the
press of horsemen for sight of Lemuel.</p>

<p>“Father!” she cried again and again, her agonized
voice rising above the chorus of menacing suggestions
as to what should be done with the meddlers
of the night’s business. But she got no answer to
her passionate cry.</p>

<p>Day was breaking fast, as is usual on the Southwestern
deserts. Soapweed Plains lay cold and gray
and mysterious to the eye, its vast stretches of brush
and sand resembling some gigantic crazy-quilted
design. The Geerusalem Hills rose near at hand,
looking like a great dab of mixed paint—a vividly
mineralized pile of granite and porphyritic rock.</p>

<p>Rankin and two other men were conversing in
low animated tones, trying to arrive at some decision
concerning the disposal of Dot and Lex. They
were not agreeing.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot rang out from beyond the circle,
followed by the gurgling cry of a man. There
was a wild scamper of hoofs, then the sharp
crack of a quirt across a horse’s withers. A volley
screamed over the roadster. The riders clustered
around it hesitated an instant. Another volley
scattered them like chaff, dropping three of their
number. This way and that they dashed madly,
every man for himself. Rankin roared out a command,
hurling a string of oaths after them.</p>

<p>“If you’re lookin’ for Billy Gee, here he is. Come
take him! Come on, you brave wallopers! You—Rankin!”
shouted a lone horseman, sitting his
mount some distance away. He fired, and the leader’s
hat went sailing off his head. Emptying his
revolver wildly at the other, Rankin, fuming with
rage, swung his horse about and sped after his
followers.</p>

<p>A wild thrill swept Dot. She stared in blank
amazement at the erect slim figure of their rescuer.
Far behind him, racing across the plains like mad,
went another rider, her father, and Billy Gee, the
outlaw, the hero of her romantic dreams, was
covering his retreat, holding in nervous indecision
two score ruffians who faltered at the mere mention
of that magic name, which stood for open defiance
of law! She knew that Billy Gee must have been
a member of that mob, that he had joined it with
the express purpose of liberating her father at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>While she gazed at him these things flashed
through her mind; and into her bosom came an
ecstasy, sweeter than any she had ever known.
Out there in the cold gray dawn of Soapweed
Plains, was the man she loved, alone, dauntlessly
challenging a heavily armed cavalcade that had
visited its wrath on the Huntington home because
of him, a cowardly crew whom he had dispersed
with a dozen shots!</p>

<p>On and on, dashed Lemuel, horse and rider growing
smaller and smaller in the distance. The
enemy, under Rankin’s repeated abuse and threats,
had drawn rein a few hundred yards away. It
began a cautious approach, firing as it came. Billy
Gee waited. Dot, becoming alarmed at his inactivity,
now noticed that, besides being out of revolver
range, he gripped a rifle. In that he had a
decided advantage—one which he proceeded to put
to use with demoralizing effect.</p>

<p>He brought up the weapon suddenly. There was
a flash, and one of the horsemen slumped in the
saddle. Again and again the rifle cracked. The
morale of the mob ebbed in the face of that unerring
marksmanship. The outlaw reloaded, and with
something of that dare-devil spirit which had made
him the terror of the region, dug spurs to his
horse and charged straight for the nearest group
of riders, firing with deadly precision as he rode.
The group made to stand its ground, but the very
fact that this advancing foe was the dreaded bandit
of the Mohave, whose past death-defying exploits
had set them agog with awe and wonder, proved
too much for their vaunted temerity. They whirled
about in a panic, and after them went the remaining
members of the band, the rifle bullets whining
in their ears.</p>

<p>Billy Gee reined in his horse and watched the
rout he had caused. Then the very thing he
could have predicted came to pass. The horsemen
stopped a quarter of a mile off, congregated to talk
over a plan of action. Rankin was not for giving
up. Billy could hear him bellowing out commands,
urging his fellows with curse and taunt back to the
attack and the extermination of the outlaw.</p>

<h2 title='XX—Geerusalem Stirs' id='chXX'>
  CHAPTER XX—GEERUSALEM STIRS
</h2>

<p>Billy Gee galloped up to the roadster. Dot and
Lex had been standing back of it, watching
in silence the ridiculous debacle of the Quintell mob
caused by this lone knight of the road. The outlaw
jerked his horse to a stop before the two, and
glanced first at Lex, then at the girl. He smiled
at her, an odd, expectant light in his eyes, and
swept off his hat cavalierly.</p>

<p>“Yore father is headin’ for Blue Mud Spring,
Miss Huntington. Warburton is campin’ there, as
you mebby know. I reckon he’ll be safer.” He
spoke in low, gentle tones.</p>

<p>She regarded him for a moment with an eagerness
that she could not hide. The early morning
light was on his face, its subtle rosiness softening
it, showing a lingering loneliness and sympathy in
the flashing eyes, a boyishness of feature, a charming
recklessness of expression. He sat his horse
gracefully, his figure garbed in whipcord, flowing
white chaps covering his legs, his hat a splendid
huge thing of gray felt, while about his neck hung
the bandanna handkerchief that had recently served
him as a mask.</p>

<p>She blushed, approval and admiration in her eyes,
and held out her hand to him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to thank you for this, Billy
Gee,” she said simply, a quiver in her voice.</p>

<p>“You don’t never need to, Dot. I owe you a
bigger favor, you reckillect. I jest happened to
fall in with the gang as it was ridin’ out here,
an’ heerd what they were goin’ to do. But I’d
not have got away with it, if you hadn’t come along
in yore auto, Mr. Sangerly—that is, not easy,” he
added, with a look at Lex. “Of course, you know
this here’s Quintell’s doin’s. He’s payin’ pretty
for it, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>Dot was gazing fixedly at him, a wistful light
in her eyes that her heavy lashes concealed.</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that—that Quintell is at the
bottom of this thing?” asked Lex, watching the
other narrowly.</p>

<p>“Positive. All that talk about Huntington hiding
me out was a bluff. They framed it so’s to git
hold of him. I’m mighty glad Warburton’s in the
country.”</p>

<p>Sangerly smiled. “I also want to thank you for
what you’ve done for us, Billy Gee.” He added:
“And for leaving our trains alone.”</p>

<p>“A man’ll do a thing right along, Mr. Sangerly,
an’ his own mother won’t be able to change him.
Then he jest nacherly changes.” He said this
soberly, throwing a glance at the distant horsemen
as he spoke.</p>

<p>They had begun to ride forward again slowly,
in open formation, scattering to the flanks as they
came, in a wide enveloping movement calculated to
get the bandit in a crossfire that would make his
escape impossible.</p>

<p>Dot noted the maneuver and looked at Billy Gee,
mute entreaty in her eyes. He met her gaze and
laughed easily.</p>

<p>“You an’ Mr. Sangerly better wait till they start
chasin’ me, then go on into camp an’ arrange to
quit the ranch. ’Tain’t safe to live there,” he said,
as he gathered up the reins. “Quintell aims to
drive you out of the deestrict, but he won’t. An’
say, Sangerly! I wisht you’d visit him to-night.
How about eight o’clock? I want you to hear
somepn for yoreself. There’s stick-up men who
don’t use a gun like yours truly. Good-by, Dot!
I want powerful much to have a long chat with
you, some day. Did you see where Jerome Liggs
struck it rich?” With a glance at Lex, he smiled
at Dot, swept off his hat and went galloping away.</p>

<p>Wild yells broke from the advancing vigilantes.
Their revolvers began to roar, and with quirt and
spur they quickened their speed in pursuit of their
quarry. Sangerly and Dot crouched down behind
the roadster to avoid the hail of bullets that now
screamed around them. Presently the cavalcade
swept by, leaving a cloud of dust behind them,
hanging motionless on the still morning air. Lashing
their animals madly, they tore away across
the plains, bending every energy to apprehend and
vent their vengeance on the man who single-handed
had frustrated their sinister plans.</p>

<p>It was now quite light, the eastern horizon glowing
red and orange with the first shafts of the
invisible sun.</p>

<p>Billy Gee headed straight for the Huntington
ranch. His wiry little horse, trained to just such
desperate get-aways as this, swept over the ground
like the wind. Dot, her small hands clenched, her
face flushing and paling by turns with what Lex
believed was anxiety, watched the pursuit in silence.
Now and again, through a rift in the cloud of
dust, she caught sight of the lone rider. He sat
his horse with the grace of a fleeing centaur, and
she noticed that he was outdistancing his pursuers
by degrees—saving his own animal, she thought.
Once she saw him rise in his stirrups and wave
his hat. She wrenched a white scarf she wore
around her neck and waved back. After that, he
kept gaining and gaining rapidly.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful horse!” exclaimed Lex, breaking
a long silence. “Look! He’s gone past the
ranch. They’ve given up. See? They’ve stopped.
I’ve never seen such a remarkable exhibition of
pluck in all my life, Miss Huntington. He’s an
extraordinary bandit.”</p>

<p>Billy Gee, half a mile in the lead of the cavalcade,
flashed by the Huntington gate. His mother
and Tinnemaha Pete had witnessed the race. They
stood just inside the fence, trembling, breathless.</p>

<p>“Jerome, my darling!” cried Mrs. Liggs wildly.</p>

<p>“I’m all right, honey,” Billy Gee called back,
throwing her a smile. “I’ve headed Huntington
for Blue Mud Spring. Dot an’ Sangerly got by.
See you soon.”</p>

<p>“The sheriff—look out for that pesky critter,
Warburton!” shrilled Tinnemaha Pete. “He’s
lookin’ for you. Pop it to him, d’you hear! Pop
it to him——”</p>

<p>“Jerome—the sheriff!” screamed Mrs. Liggs.</p>

<p>Billy Gee, out of hearing, nodded reassuringly,
wondering what they had said.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile beyond the ranch, he pulled
his horse down to a walk. Pursuit had been
abandoned. He laughed, sitting sidelong in the
saddle, gazing back. Suddenly, as if in his very
ear, a man’s voice rang out, saying:</p>

<p>“I got a bead on yore heart, Billy. Don’t look
around. I don’t want to have to kill you, Billy.”</p>

<p>His horse was brought to a stop, and an expert
hand reached up and disarmed him.</p>

<p>“Hullo Bob! Much obliged for bein’ so consid’rate,”
said the outlaw, his head averted. “You’re
jest the man I want to see.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet I am,” chuckled Sheriff Warburton
grimly. “Le’s see yore hands! All set, now.” He
snapped the handcuffs on his prisoner.</p>

<p>Billy Gee turned and looked at his captor. He
was afoot. Some distance off, his mule stood
partially hidden by a clump of brush.</p>

<p>“If you don’t figger on losin’ me, we better
start. That roarin’ layout is the Quintell bunch.
They’re after me. They all but dynamited the
Huntington place last night,” said Billy Gee evenly.</p>

<p>Warburton scowled. “What’s this you’re givin’
me?”</p>

<p>He glanced toward the ranch and made out the
tiny figure of Mrs. Liggs standing in the garden,
her face buried in her hands, and the scarecrow one
of old Tinnemaha Pete, arms waving above his
head, raging about in insane fashion.</p>

<p class='mt10'>The mob had collected and, slouching in its saddles,
listened to Big George Rankin’s reasons why
the chase should not be continued. Daylight had
brought the leader of Geerusalem’s underworld face
to face with the gravity of the night’s activity.
Masked men were likely to fall into the toils of
the law, even in so lawless a locality as this.
Rankin did not relish being identified with the
Huntington job. He had too much to lose. He did
not care to take any unnecessary risks. What he
told his confederates, however, was that they would
be wasting time trying to track down an outlaw
who, besides riding superior horseflesh, knew every
square foot of the vast Mohave Desert.</p>

<p>At last, they started on their return to camp,
tired, hungry, in no genial mood. Their raid had
in great measure been for naught. Their plans
to intimidate Lemuel Huntington into leaving the
country, had been frustrated by the unexpected
interference of Billy Gee. They had to confront
Jule Quintell and his clique and admit miscarriage
of those plans.</p>

<p>From discussing the matter among themselves,
their bitterness toward Huntington, and every one
who had to do with Huntington, increased. Lex
Sangerly, Dot, and Mrs. Liggs came under a new
scheme of persecution which they presently determined
on, as they rode along. They would raid
the ranch again that night, declared Rankin, and
burn it to the ground, and they would take precautions
that no Billy Gee would be about to defeat
their aims. It is not strange that, with other more
important matters in contemplation, the absence of
Shorty and Logan—delegated to kill Lennox—was
not noted. In fact, Shorty and Logan were not
missed until late that afternoon.</p>

<p class='mt10'>For some reason that Lex Sangerly could not
understand, it was with manifest reluctance that
Dot finally agreed to accompany him into Geerusalem.
She favored returning to the ranch, in the
face of the knowledge that they would have to
pass the disgruntled night riders approaching along
the road.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Liggs will be safe until we come back,”
argued Lex, as they went whirling away. “This
fellow, Billy Gee, doesn’t seem like a man who
would harm a defenseless old lady. Wasn’t that
the most spectacular rescue, Miss Huntington?”</p>

<p>“I am sure he wouldn’t harm her,” said Dot
slowly. “He’s wonderful! One man against forty
cowardly curs. Didn’t I tell you in San Francisco
what an extraordinary person he was?”</p>

<p>“He certainly isn’t what I’ve always pictured
a bandit to be. He’s got character in his face. A
good eye. A rather likable fellow, I’d say.”</p>

<p>She looked at him. “You’re going to meet him
to-night, Mr. Sangerly. I know you’re going to
admire Billy Gee hereafter. Hasn’t it struck you as
odd that he is trusting you? What assurance has
he that you won’t have him placed under arrest?”</p>

<p>“My understanding was that I was to visit Quintell.
I didn’t suppose that I was to meet him
there, also,” said Lex coldly. “Keeping an appointment
with a criminal, Miss Huntington, is not exactly——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sangerly, please don’t ask me how I know,
but this meeting will be to your interest. I am
positive of it. I feel it, with a woman’s intuition.
Can’t you see that he is really risking his liberty
so that you may hear something for yourself?
That’s just what he said. He knows who you
are—all about you. And you must bear in mind
that there have been no more holdups on the Mohave &amp; Southwestern.
He has reformed. Please don’t
smile. He has. I want to ask this favor of you:
Meet him to-night, as you would keep any appointment,
but not with an officer at your elbow. Will
you do that?”</p>

<p>She had spoken rapidly, a strange, eager, pleading
note in her voice. Her eyes, fixed on him, held
an animated light, her cheeks the faintest tint of
red. They were just turning into Geerusalem
Gulch, the rays of the rising sun silvering the
windows of the camp a mile away.</p>

<p>For a long moment, Lex stared at her, searching
her pretty face. Then he broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>“If I didn’t know better, I’d say you were—well,
an ardent admirer of this far-famed train robber,
and that would be putting it mildly. But your
arguments are reasonable. I’ll do it. I promise
to meet him under those conditions—this one time.
You appear to know a lot about Billy Gee, don’t
you, Miss Huntington?” he added curiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind confessing to you that I do,” she
admitted in a naïve way that quite amazed him.
“I can tell you that your road will never be robbed
again by him.”</p>

<p>“Are you serious about that?” he asked. “It
seems to me that a young woman of your standing
wouldn’t be in a position to——”</p>

<p>“I was never more serious in my life, Mr.
Sangerly, and as far as position is concerned,
there are no social planes in this great land of
sun, sand and silence. We are all human beings,
some more fortunate than others, but no better under
the skin.”</p>

<p>She met his look with a candor that caused him
to gaze ahead, frowning at the road. There was
a short silence.</p>

<p>“It—it isn’t possible that you have—influenced
him?” he said hesitatingly, after a little.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I wouldn’t just call it that.
I told you how he hid the twenty thousand dollars
in my bureau drawer, unknown to me? Well, during
the talk I had with him, I asked him if he
would do something to repay me for taking care of
him. He replied that he would—anything. And
I exacted his promise that he would quit leading
the life of a bandit. It was all done in one thrilling
moment—one midnight. Posses were scouring
the country for him at the time. He promised me,
as you’ve just promised me. He’s made good. I
think he’s magnificent.”</p>

<p>As Lex brought the roadster to a stop before
the Miners’ Hotel, he said: “By the way, Billy
Gee mentioned Jerome Liggs as though he knew
him. Does he happen to be a relative of Mrs.
Liggs? She had a son——”</p>

<p>“He is, and I know him.” She regarded Lex
intently as she spoke.</p>

<p>“But that was her son’s name. We were kids
together—chums.”</p>

<p>“It is he,” she said slowly.</p>

<p>Lex sat bolt upright, forgetting to clamber out
of the roadster. Just then he was oblivious of the
fact that a crowd was gathering on the sidewalk,
and that Dot was the object of many eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, she told me he was dead!” he burst out.
“I saw in the paper yesterday that he struck it
rich. Where is he——”</p>

<p>The increasing buzz of voices around him made
him glance up. He saw the throng of staring men.
They packed the sidewalk, spilled into the street,
partly surrounding the machine. There was something
inimical in their manner, a bold severity in
their scrutiny of Dot. Lex’s sudden display of
astonishment and pleasure passed at sight of that
menacing crowd. He sprang out of the car and
threw open the door for the girl.</p>

<p>The hostility in the faces of the men had not
been lost on Dot. It struck her instantly that this
was not the elemental type of ruffian who had
wrecked her home some hours before. These grim
accusing individuals were substantial business men—the
commercial backbone of Geerusalem. She
grew pale.</p>

<p>Clinging to Lex’s arm, she entered the hotel, the
crowd parting to let them pass. Once inside and
with Mr. Merriman, the proprietor, hurrying toward
them, she breathed easier. He beckoned them into a
little writing room that adjoined the office.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Huntington in camp?” he asked in low,
excited tones.</p>

<p>Dot shook her head. “Get word to him not
to show up here—to keep away,” he went on rapidly.
“The report has got around that he’s been hiding
Billy Gee, the outlaw. He is accused of being an
accomplice, of being the relative or friend that
the bandit was generally supposed to have on the
plains. The camp is furious—ready to riot. They
held a mass meeting last night and decided to——”</p>

<p>“That’s ridiculous, Mr. Merriman. It’s persecution,”
cried Lex. “I just came from the ranch
with Miss Huntington. I’ve been staying there.
I know what I’m talking about. The report is
a lie. Who circulated it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But Jule Quintell acted as chairman
of the meeting and did most of the speaking.
Whether it’s true or not, the camp believes it.
They’re backing Quintell to a man. They won’t
stop at anything——”</p>

<p>“The beast!” broke in Dot, her eyes fiery with
suppressed rage. “He sent a gang of his hoodlums
out to our home last night, and they all but destroyed
it, Mr. Merriman.” She turned to Sangerly.
“Would you please send a machine out after Mrs.
Liggs? We must not leave her alone out there.
Tinnemaha Pete can look after—you know, the
sick man. And do try to reach Sheriff Warburton
at Blue Mud Spring. Mr. Merriman, have you a
messenger we can trust? I’m going to have Quintell
arrested.”</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='XXI—The Law and the Lawless' id='chXXI'>
  CHAPTER XXI—THE LAW AND THE LAWLESS
</h2>

<p>When Lex was gone, Dot gave the sympathetic
hotel man the details of the raid on the
ranch, omitting nothing except the fact of her
father’s abduction and subsequent rescue; for she
believed it unwise at this time when Lemuel was
being accused of having friendly relations with
Billy Gee, to mention the important part—heroic
and praiseworthy though it was—the latter had
played in the night’s events. She was positive that
the raiders themselves would keep silent on the
matter, if for no other reason than to cover up
the lawlessness of their own act.</p>

<p>“But have you any proof that Quintell is at the
bottom of this persecution, Dot?” asked Merriman,
when she concluded.</p>

<p>“No. Not direct proof, but——”</p>

<p>“In that case, I wouldn’t make any rash move.
If you have him arrested, it will simply aggravate
the situation. You’d be worse off for it. Right
now, Quintell is a power in Geerusalem. He is
the new president of the Mining Exchange, besides.
His clique is in absolute control. You couldn’t
get a person to believe your charges. I’d advise
you to wait—talk it over with Warburton first.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Merriman, this whole thing is a plot
to ruin us,” cried the girl. “I don’t know why.
We have never had dealings with the people of
this camp, except to patronize the stores, and all
our bills are paid. In the light of what happened
last night, would you have us fold our hands and
let them do what they seem bent on doing—force
us to leave the country?”</p>

<p>Merriman patted her shoulder paternally. “I’m
sure it’s not as bad as all that, Dot,” he said with
a smile. “Things will adjust themselves, I know.
Right now, the prudent course to pursue is to say
nothing and see that your father remains away
for a while.”</p>

<p>Dot gazed significantly at him a moment, then
she said: “Quintell was out to see father early
last evening. He wanted to buy the ranch. He
offered better than thirty dollars an acre—ten thousand
dollars. Would you pay that much for the
Huntington ranch, Mr. Merriman, just as it stands?”</p>

<p>The man’s eyes opened wide with surprise. He
whistled softly and replied, with a shrewd nod of
his head: “So that’s it! I think I see the scheme,
Dot—and it is a scheme. Something about your
father’s ranch has made it valuable to Jule. And
it’s mineral—nothing less. I’d say it was pretty
good, because he never bothers with anything that
isn’t pretty good. He’s liable to go the limit, Dot.
Perhaps I shouldn’t say it, but he can be mighty
dirty in his methods.”</p>

<p>“You might be right, but I don’t think he wants
the ranch for the mineral that may be on it,” said
the girl. “I am sure he has some other object.
Did you ever hear talk of a resort, to be established
a few miles out of camp?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean a summer resort?”</p>

<p>“Yes, something on that order.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “I was discussing with Harrison,
Quintell’s secretary, some weeks ago, the possibility
of starting such an enterprise. He seemed interested—enthusiastic,
I might say. I believe we mentioned
your father’s ranch as one of the sites. Of
course, you understand, we were just speculating.
While a resort would be a veritable mint once it
got going, the initial investment would be prohibitive
so far as I’m concerned. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>Dot’s eyes glowed on him. “Mr. Merriman, if I
entertained any doubts as to whether Quintell had
a hand in last night’s outrage, you have dispelled
them,” she said. Thereupon, she related to him
the particulars of Dick Lennox’s visit to her and
Lemuel at the Golden West Hotel in San Francisco.</p>

<p>They were still talking when Lex returned. He
announced that he had dispatched a machine to
bring Mrs. Liggs to camp, and instructed the driver
to tell Warburton—in the event the latter was at
the ranch—that Dot wished to see him immediately.
Moreover, he had sent a cowboy riding for Blue
Mud Springs, with a letter counseling Lemuel to
remain in hiding, as well as requesting Warburton’s
presence in Geerusalem.</p>

<p>While Dot and Lex were at breakfast in the
hotel dining room, six horsemen rode singly out
of camp. They were armed. They were old in
the game of hip-shooting—practiced in the grim art
of killing. They could keep a can dancing in midair
as long as loaded six-shooters held out. In
the pocket of each was a neat little roll of bills,
slipped there by Jule Quintell’s right bower, Harrison.
Their instructions were to seize the hill
on the Huntington ranch, destroy the location monuments
and notices on what were known as the
Billy Geerusalem group of claims—locators, Tinnemaha
Pete Boyd and Jerome Liggs—and relocate
over their own signatures.</p>

<p>Reposing in Quintell’s safe in the Broker’s Exchange
Building were deeds signed in advance by
the six, which transferred what they intended to
get possession of to the boss of Geerusalem and
his associates. The deep motive beneath this move,
however, was the death of Jerome Liggs and Tinnemaha
Pete. That Dot’s father escaped a similar
sentence was due, not entirely to Quintell’s hesitation
to take so rash a step, as to the fact that,
after hearing the report of the vigilantes’ work as
given by Big George Rankin, the broker—following
a furious scene in his office—had arrived at the
conclusion that the havoc wrought at the ranch
coupled with the terror with which Huntington and
his daughter must be now inspired, sufficed to force
them into a position to meet his terms for the purchase
of the ranch.</p>

<p>But of his contemplated cold-blooded murder of
the discoverers of the rich Billy Geerusalem strike,
Quintell said nothing to his associates. Their putting
away had nothing directly to do with this
obvious act of dispossession. As has been said,
Huntington owned the land on which the bonanza
find had been made; the broker knew this and,
in consequence, realized only too well that legal
right to it must come from its owner, who, it must
be remembered, had not the remotest idea of the
fabulous treasure buried in the bleak, solitary hill
west of his home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Quintell was busy stirring up public
sentiment in the camp against Huntington. He had
called a meeting the night before and charged that
Billy Gee, the outlaw, had been found in hiding
on the Huntington ranch. While he had not seen
the bandit, Quintell gave a graphic account of an
exciting chase after that elusive person, which had
terminated when Sheriff Warburton mistook him
for Billy Gee in the darkness, and dragged him
into the house, resulting in the outlaw’s escape.</p>

<p>His whole story was a clever network of lies,
convincingly told, and calculated to brand Dot’s
father as an undesirable resident, if nothing worse;
one who was scarcely as honest as Billy Gee, since
Quintell made him appear as an accomplice who had
been masquerading for years in the rôle of a
reputable, law-abiding rancher. Moreover, he assailed
Warburton by pointing to the latter’s friendship
for Huntington, and intimated that Billy Gee’s
sensational get-away from the sheriff, following
Lemuel’s delivery of his prisoner to the official, was
framed for the purpose of getting the reward which,
he gave as his opinion, had been divided equally
among the three. And because Quintell had a
smooth tongue and a way of putting things over,
Geerusalem believed his charges.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour—ten o’clock—Lex Sangerly
left Dot in the hotel parlor and stepped over to
Quintell’s office to accompany the broker on an
inspection tour of the Lucky Boy placer claims.
He went with reluctance, feeling more keenly than
on the day previous his suspicions of Quintell in
regard to the right of way matter, to which was
added a profound indignation and rage against this
wildcatter who was, from all Lex could hear, the
cause of the Huntington raid.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Lex’s departure, Mrs. Liggs
and Sheriff Warburton arrived in camp, and, as
the result of a short talk he had with Dot, Warburton
prevailed on her to take no immediate action
looking to the arrest of Quintell, until he had investigated
the case. Leaving the two women, he
strolled out of the hotel and stood listening to a
discussion going on among the members of a crowd
of men standing before the entrance. Lemuel
Huntington was being roundly condemned. There
were ominous grumblings, threats being voiced;
mob law was being openly fomented. To Warburton,
wise in the psychology of crime and the
natures of men, darkness alone was needed to
spread the flame of lawlessness over that wild
desert settlement. It would sweep through the
underworld section, and thence from one mine bunk
house to another, calling out the habitués of the
dens and the grimy underground workers to mass
in one vicious, formidable army, that, venting its
violence on the Huntington ranch and its household,
might finish out the night with an orgy of
destruction and murder in the camp itself.</p>

<p>He looked up and down the street. Groups of
men were everywhere. His eyes rested on the gilt
sign bearing Quintell’s name, on the Brokers’ Exchange
Building. A grim smile parted his lips.
Quintell was surely a power in Geerusalem, he told
himself. Presently his eye fell on the dapper figure
of the town constable. The fellow, in correct
mining camp attire—the rakish cut approved by
the ranking element—stood spread-legged on the
sidewalk, complacently smoking a cigarette. Warburton’s
jaws set. He strode over to the man.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Mitchell!” he said gruffly.</p>

<p>The other glanced at the sheriff’s face with its
two weeks’ growth of bristly whiskers, at the dirty
shirt and overalls, then back at their owner’s face.</p>

<p>“It isn’t possible that it’s Sheriff Warburton?”
he began, with a grin.</p>

<p>“It is. When I’m doin’ my duty, Mitchell, I
don’t tog up. I’d like to talk to you a minute.”
He led the way to the hotel office, halting just
inside the entrance. “What’re you goin’ to do
about this thing—all this lynch-law stuff they’re
cookin’ up?” he asked.</p>

<p>The constable chuckled. “Do? Why, I’m powerless
to do anything. A man would be crazy to
interfere. The sentiment of the camp is such that
if I butted in, they’d swear I was trying to protect
Huntington and——”</p>

<p>“What’re you sportin’ that tin buzzer for,” broke
in Warburton, with a contemptuous nod at the
silver star on the breast of Mitchell’s tailored coat.</p>

<p>The man flushed angrily. “Say, Warburton,
what’s eating you, anyhow?” he asked defiantly.
“I’m constable of this township and——”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out what’s eatin’ me, in jest about
ten minutes,” snapped the sheriff. “You git on
the job or, by God, you’ll wisht you had! I’m
tellin’ you somepn, Mitchell.” Glaring at the other,
he turned and walked out of the door.</p>

<p>Mitchell’s rough laugh followed him.</p>

<p>Raging inwardly, cursing to himself, Warburton
halted on the sidewalk. Word of his presence in
camp had traveled like magic, and the crowd before
the hotel was fast filling the street from curb
to curb. It was an ominous crowd, the dregs of
the settlement mingling with the army of mine
workers, with here and there one of Quintell’s
associates, circulating through the ranks whispering
words of advice. Standing there in full view
of the multitude, glancing it over, Warburton
marked the hostility in its look and attitude.
Caustic remarks began to be directed at him.</p>

<p>“Where’s your bandit friend, sheriff?”</p>

<p>“Hey, fellers, there’s Huntington’s bodyguard!”</p>

<p>“Billy Gee’s duck-hunting on the Huntington
ranch, Warburton. Why don’t you go get him?”</p>

<p>Warburton’s jaw set. His eyes flickered dangerously.
A few yards away, grouped together on
the sidewalk, stood a dozen or more cow-punchers—members
of the Las Animas ranch, a large
principality of fertile range on the north rim of
Soapweed Plains—their great hats and gaudy silk
neckerchiefs conspicuous in that sea of drab sameness.
Having nothing in common with the men of
the mines, they stood, curious spectators of the
drama that was being enacted before them, maintaining
a strictly neutral attitude in an affair of
which they knew absolutely nothing. They had
arrived in camp an hour before for a three-day
lark and, true to the traditions of their kind, were
willing to accept whatever fate tendered them—so
long as it promised a departure from the usual
humdrum of their daily existence.</p>

<p>Warburton gave them a significant look, then he
faced the crowd again and raised his hand for
silence.</p>

<p>So it was, that, as Quintell, accompanied by
Lex Sangerly, Harrison, and two other men drove
down the street in a machine bound for the Lucky
Boy placer claims, they found the greatest throng
ever assembled in Geerusalem gathered before the
Miners’ Hotel, listening to Sheriff Warburton’s defense
of Lemuel Huntington. The official was speaking
vehemently, angrily, looking massive and potential
from his elevated position on a hotel chair.</p>

<p>Quintell, who was driving, steered the car through
the jam of men to a point opposite the speaker.
He was pale, his eyes blazing with hatred. Warburton
was just bringing his talk to a conclusion.</p>

<p>“An’ that’s how I happen to be in these parts.
I’ve swore to git Billy Gee, dead or alive, an’
that’s what I aim to do. I was at the ranch last
night from start to finish—like I jest said. An’
the man that says Lem Huntington is in cahoots
with Billy Gee is a damn liar.”</p>

<p>Quintell slipped out from back of the steering
wheel and stood up. Neatly groomed, his appearance—compared
with the sheriff’s—at once dignified
and impressive, he merited in every particular the
title he had earned—boss of Geerusalem. With a
sharp glance over the crowd, he began in a slow,
ringing voice:</p>

<p>“Men of Geerusalem! I want you to all know
that, regardless of what this sheriff of San Buenaventura
County has said, he is not only an intimate
friend of Lemuel Huntington, but the very man
who has let Billy Gee slip through his fingers twice.
There stands efficiency for you.” He leveled an
accusing finger at Warburton. “There’s the stripe
of official the taxpayers of this county are supporting—an
official who has the audacity to address
an intelligent audience of this kind in an
endeavor to whitewash the shrewdest crook who
ever betrayed the trust of the good people of this
camp and section. Gentlemen, it’s this official’s
word against mine. I charge Lemuel Huntington
with being on intimate terms with an outlaw.
Whom are you going to believe?”</p>

<p>A wild, deafening roar went up, increasing in
volume as Warburton, his face purple with fury,
made an attempt to speak.</p>

<p>“Lynch him! Lynch him! Get Huntington!”
howled the multitude.</p>

<p>They swarmed about Quintell’s machine, clamoring
their approval of the broker. The din and excitement
grew. Sheriff Warburton stood deserted,
ignored, outraged. The veins on his forehead and
neck were swelled to bursting, his big hands opened
and shut with an odd, slow movement. Lex Sangerly,
sitting in the seat beside Quintell, watched
him curiously. From behind the curtains of a
second-story window, Dot and Mrs. Liggs looked
down terrified at the mob of infuriated men.</p>

<p>Warburton’s eyes sought the group of cow-punchers
again. He stepped down off the chair
and reached them in two strides. A few curt
words sent them hurrying off to a stable around
the nearest corner. Then, his jaw set determinedly,
the sheriff elbowed his way through the
crowd to the side of Quintell’s machine.</p>

<p>“I’m warnin’ every man here ag’in startin’ anything,”
he shouted. “As sheriff of this county,
I’ll enforce the law if I got to shoot to do it.
Understand that! An’ if I can’t do it, there’s
national guards that kin. Keep away from Huntington
an’ his ranch, if you ain’t lookin’ for
trouble.” He turned to Quintell, who stood eying
him venomously. “As for you, Mr. Man, if you
don’t want to be throwed in for inspirin’ violence,
you’d better git a-goin’. Drive on, or I’ll show
you what kind of an official you got to deal with!”</p>

<p>Quintell hesitated; then he slid reluctantly into
his seat. As the car started moving off, he fastened
his fiery gaze on Warburton.</p>

<p>“We’ll meet again, sheriff,” he snarled back.
“You can’t bluff me. You may protect a crook,
but you won’t get away with it—not if I can stop
it! Huntington goes. Remember that!”</p>

<p>The cow-punchers of the Las Animas ranch
came spurring into the street at that moment, and
at Warburton’s orders began dispersing the crowd.
A little later, while Constable Mitchell was indignantly
condemning the sheriff’s action to a group
of Quintell’s supporters in the hotel office, Warburton
entered and placed him under arrest and
marched him off to the camp’s jail. Relieving him
of his keys, the sheriff locked the fellow in a cell
and placed two riders on guard.</p>

<p>“This ain’t very formal, Mitchell,” he said grimly,
“’cos I ain’t got time to monkey with warrants
and citations. You kin take yore pick whether
you turn in yore star or git yanked up before the
grand jury.”</p>

<h2 title='XXII—A Showdown' id='chXXII'>
  CHAPTER XXII—A SHOWDOWN
</h2>

<p>The day passed slowly. It was a day throbbing
with threat and tragedy on the eve of happening.
Night fell, but there was no noticeable change
in the situation. Legitimate places of business
closed early; and singularly enough the usual
crowds that streamed up and down the main street
were absent, the dance halls and gambling hells
deserted, the camp strangely, ominously peaceful.</p>

<p>For one thing, public sentiment against Lemuel
Huntington had crystallized rather than abated.
Sheriff Warburton’s drastic action together with his
threat to call for the militia in the event he could
not handle the disorder, stirred the Quintell forces
to violent hatred. What inflamed them most was
the fact that he had dispatched a number of his
deputized cow-punchers to guard the Huntington
ranch. That the official was protecting a criminal
and not taking steps to capture that criminal, became
the burden of the Quintell element’s cry in
order to win over to their side the minority law-abiding
population of the town.</p>

<p>During the afternoon a number of incidents had
occurred which did anything but relieve the tension.
The first of these was the arrival of a desperately
wounded horseman. He came riding up the street,
half hanging out of his saddle, semiconscious, a
gaping wound in his side. He proved to be one
of the six expert gunmen sent by Quintell to dispossess
and murder the discoverers of the Billy
Geerusalem bonanza strike. He died, and the name
of his slayer died with him. Quintell, raging in
his office, waited for the return of the other five.
When they did not report, he had Big George
Rankin take two automobile loads of men to the
scene, with instructions to seize the claims at all
cost. Rankin came back an hour later, stating
that they had been stopped by a body of armed
cowboys patrolling the plains in the neighborhood of
the Huntington ranch.</p>

<p>Another significant move, traceable to the
emergency methods and industry of Sheriff Warburton,
was the sudden appearance in Geerusalem
of a growing army of these self-same cowboys.
They began arriving at intervals, throughout the
afternoon, riding up the street singly and in pairs,
in dozens and by the score. They came heavily
armed, delegation after delegation of them, grim-faced,
wiry, silent men who feared neither man
nor devil. Every ranch in that far-flung, fertile
hill territory—known as the Green Range—to the
north of Soapweed Plains, became represented as
the day wore on. For Warburton had dispatched
Las Animas riders speeding through the desert, appealing
to the ranch owners for help to nip in
the bud the reign of rioting and bloodshed which
threatened to sweep the camp.</p>

<p>In the midst of this menacing state of affairs,
Lex Sangerly had returned from an inspection of
the Lucky Boy placer group, at the mouth of Geerusalem
Gulch, the conviction now firm in his
mind that the Quintell outfit had salted the ground
over which the proposed branch line of the
Mohave &amp; Southwestern must of necessity pass to reach
its terminal in the settlement. He had watched
Harrison taking samples of the gravel, here and
there, and had seen those samples turned over to
the assayer—himself retaining duplicates of each,
for purposes of a check-up.</p>

<p>It had all seemed part of a clean transaction,
except when he had manifested the desire of himself
choosing a second test of the ground. To this
Quintell politely demurred, going so far as to declare
that he and his associates were in no wise
eager for a track to cross the claims, since it
would interfere greatly with the extensive work
they planned. He pointed out, too, that the matter
of purchase had come from the railroad company,
that he and his partners had made no overtures
with a view to disposing of a right of way.</p>

<p>While Lex was waiting at the Miners’ Hotel for
the assayer’s report on the samples, his father—Western
manager of the road—arrived from Los
Angeles unexpectedly. Sangerly, senior, a clean,
sharp-eyed man of fifty, with a close-cropped
mustache and thick, stiff, iron-gray hair, was accompanied
by the State traffic manager, a Mr.
Hudson, a quiet, mild type of person whose one
distinctive trait was his ability to listen and say
nothing. Lex’s father, it seems, had determined,
following receipt of his son’s telegram the day before,
on taking a personal hand in the negotiations
for the purchase of the Lucky Boy right of way.</p>

<p>After spending some time in a happy renewal
of his old friendship with little Mrs. Liggs and a
talk with Dot, Mr. Sangerly, accompanied by Hudson
and Lex, held a conference with the owners of
the placer claims in Jule Quintell’s offices. The
certificates of assay showed the ground to be rich—thanks
to Harrison’s precision in the old-time
art of salting. As Lex had surmised, the price demanded
by the Lucky Boy coterie for the privilege
of laying the M. &amp; S. tracks across their fabulous
claims was correspondingly large. It was excessive,
staggering in the circumstances—fifty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>The conference came to an end without an agreement
being reached. The railroad men would take
the proposition under advisement, they said. The
coterie smiled pleasantly; they had the company in
the hollow of their hand. It would have to buy.
There was no other way to enter Geerusalem except
through Geerusalem Gulch.</p>

<p>Briefly, when night settled on that waspish little
desert gold camp, Quintell and his circle were apparently
in command of the situation. First, they
had the population thoroughly aroused against
Lemuel Huntington—the man himself was in hiding
for his life—and it would be only a question
of time before he could be induced to dispose of
his holdings in a community inimical to him.
Again, they had the Mohave &amp; Southwestern in a
position where it must either meet their terms or
build the terminal out on a rocky wash far beyond
the confines of the camp. As for Sheriff Warburton,
Quintell cursed him, laughed at his hick
methods, boasted to his confederates that he was
considering having the official ridden out of town
on a rail.</p>

<p>However, with the success of his double plots
all but realized, Jule Quintell worried. He wondered
whether Tinnemaha Pete and Jerome Liggs
had been dispatched. He couldn’t believe that the
other five expert gunmen had suffered the fate of
the one who had died without speaking.</p>

<p>As has been said, it was mysteriously quiet in
Geerusalem on this night. Few were about, and
save for the tramp of horses’ hoofs, announcing to
listening ears the presence of Warburton’s cow-punchers
patrolling the settlement, and the din of
orchestras from the brilliantly lighted dance halls,
one would have readily affirmed that the sheriff’s
summary action had restored law and order to a
hitherto unknown degree. The truth was, Geerusalem
waited in the security of its home, restless
and vengeful, thirsting to riot—waited on orders
from Big George Rankin and watched the
clock. The dynamite squad was abroad.</p>

<p>Shortly before eight, a little old man came
stumping out of the darkness of a side street. He
paused in the flood of light pouring out of a
saloon. It was Tinnemaha Pete. He looked about
him, confused. Though he knew the vast Mohave
Desert as a child did its rudimentary A B C’s,
he knew little or nothing about Geerusalem, particularly
by night. Just now, he gazed timidly
into the saloon, stroking his thin beard with a
tremulous hand. A man came out of the place
presently, and the desertarian stopped him to ask
where Jule Quintell lived.</p>

<p>Having got his directions, he stumbled away
through the dark and found the neat, rock bungalow
built on the crest of a small hill that partially
overlooked the camp. Light shone through the
spacious windows, and the sound of an operatic
selection being played on a phonograph came to
his ears. He fixed the location of the house firmly
in his capricious old brain and hobbled back the
way he had come. Not remembering having ever
seen the man Jule Quintell, he wondered curiously
what this popular broker, the boss of Geerusalem,
looked like.</p>

<p>At about the same time, Dot, in the parlor of
the Miners’ Hotel, was reminding Lex Sangerly that
he had an appointment with Billy Gee at the home
of Jule Quintell. But Lex was wrought up over
the uncompromising attitude of the broker in the
matter of the right of way transaction and held
out against giving him even the satisfaction of a
visit.</p>

<p>“But I wanted to accompany you, Mr. Sangerly,
and we’ll ask your father to go along, too,” she
urged.</p>

<p>He looked at her in surprise. Then he laughed.
“Why, you wouldn’t think of such a thing, Miss
Huntington, and I know it! You just want me
to meet Billy Gee, and——”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “But I do. I’m going to
confront him. I’m going to accuse him of having
inspired the work of that mob last night.” She
broke off, then resumed in another voice: “My
poor father hiding at Blue Mud Spring, like a
criminal, both of us driven from home, dreading
to go back to that ruined house! Don’t you understand
how I feel?” She looked at him, and he
noted the tragic, hunted expression in her eyes.
“I feel, Mr. Sangerly, that something must come
of this visit. I can’t tell you just why, but I have
a premonition that you are going to be indebted
to—to Billy Gee.”</p>

<p>Lex gazed soberly at her for some seconds.
“Very well, we’ll go,” he said at last; “and I
promised you I’d not have an officer at my elbow,
didn’t I?”</p>

<p>A little later, accompanied by the elder Sangerly,
Lex and Dot set out for the Quintell bungalow,
the hotel porter leading the way. The spacious
windows were still ablaze, the phonograph still
executing its operatic serenade. Harrison, Quintell’s
man Friday, opened the door for them, and ushered
them into the large living room, furnished with a
magnificence so wholly unexpected in this desert
as to bewilder visitors.</p>

<p>Quintell entered shortly from the library where
he sat reading. He was dressed in a rich lounging
robe and smoked a long calabash pipe. He greeted
them with his most winning smile and, seating himself,
let his eyes rest on Dot. As the preliminary
talk proceeded, he kept glancing at her frequently,
his look one of undisguised approval and admiration.</p>

<p>“I am deeply interested in the novel I hear you’re
writing, Miss Huntington,” he said. “I am informed
you’ve paid me the honor of using me as a character
in the book. Mr. Sangerly has perhaps told
you that I’ll purchase five hundred copies.”</p>

<p>“Rest assured the character will be true to life,
at any rate,” replied Dot simply.</p>

<p>“Ah—yes, doubtless!” smiled Quintell, and went
on: “I regret very much to hear that you suffered
at the hands of that mob, last night, Miss Huntington.
Personally, I’m opposed to violence of that
sort. It would seem to me that in this case where
your father has been found to be on intimate terms
with Billy Gee, instead of venting its spite by
such destructive methods, the populace should insist——”</p>

<p>Dot flushed with anger at the palpable deceit in
the man’s demeanor. “Pardon me, Mr. Quintell,”
she broke in, “but I understand from a reliable
source that you were instrumental in this violence
which you now pretend to deprecate. I came here
this evening to find out if you are man enough to
show your hand.” Her eyes were on him fixedly,
fiery.</p>

<p>He calmly removed his calabash from his mouth.
“My dear young lady,” he replied in measured
tones, “it strikes me that you might have visited
me at my office, instead of disturbing the peace
of my home in this manner. However, allow me
to tell you that, having nothing to gain and not
harboring any ill feeling against your father, I certainly
would not urge the action taken by that
mob. Perhaps you’ll now tell me who your reliable
source of information was?”</p>

<p>The girl was silent, studying him wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Billy Gee told us,” asserted Lex, speaking for
the first time; “and he seemed to know what he
was talking about,” he added significantly. His
father turned wide, horrified eyes on him.</p>

<p>“Billy Gee!” cried Quintell. He threw back his
head and laughed aloud. “In Heaven’s name! Is it
possible that the officials of the Mohave &amp; Southwestern
are also involved along with Lem Huntington
in the heroic exploits of this romantic train
robber? Tell me,” he continued tauntingly, “have
these reported train holdups I’ve read so much
about been a little stunt to advertise your road,
similar to ‘Death Valley’ Scott’s transcontinental run
a few years ago—to snare the gullible tourists to
California?”</p>

<p>Lex winced at the insult. “You may draw
whatever conclusion you choose, Quintell,” he said
coolly. “The point is that Miss Huntington is here
to speak with you about——”</p>

<p>“I have already answered Miss Huntington’s
question,” cut in the other, and there was a trace
of a sneer in his voice. “I don’t feel myself called
upon to refute the statement of a common criminal.
Another thing, the citizens’ committee, of which I
am chairman, decided at a meeting this afternoon
to give Mr. Huntington twenty-four hours—or until
six o’clock to-morrow evening—to dispose of his
property, settle up his affairs, and leave Soapweed
Plains. We have found him undesirable. We do
not want him here. What steps will be taken,
should he fail to comply with the order——”</p>

<p>A cry of horror burst from Dot. She rose to
her feet, pale and trembling. She stared wildly,
dumbly, from Lex to his father, then fearfully at
the broker.</p>

<p>“Good God, Quintell!” gasped young Sangerly.
“You certainly aren’t going to be a party to this
atrocity? It’s unjust—it’s criminal, man! Huntington
is as innocent of these charges as you are.
It’s a damnable frame-up. I’ll stake my life on his
honesty.”</p>

<p>Quintell resumed his pipe, lit it, and shrugged
his shoulders. “Well, I’m not the whole show
here. The ruling was made in open meeting, by
unanimous vote. So far as the disposal of the
property is concerned, I’ll buy it off of him—even
though he turned me down, once. But I
won’t pay a fancy price for it—it’s not worth it.”
He blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling. “As
a matter of fact, I wouldn’t touch it, if you turned
down the right of way purchase. I couldn’t. Money
is tight right now.”</p>

<p>Dot, struck speechless by this appalling announcement,
now found her voice. Defiance flashed from
her eyes; her pretty face set with a furious purpose.
“Mr. Quintell,” she cried, “you and your
committee may continue to issue orders. You may
make whatever decisions you wish. I defy you to
put them into execution. I’ll take it personally on
myself to see that my father leaves the plains in
the morning. But I remain. Do you understand?
I remain! I want to see how many men in Geerusalem
will take sides against a woman. And
when it suits me to sell the Huntington ranch——”</p>

<p>“I’ll buy it!” snapped out the elder Sangerly.
He said it harshly, violently.</p>

<p>A sudden tense silence fell. Quintell straightened
noticeably in his chair. His teeth clenched hard
over the calabash. The Western manager of the
Mohave &amp; Southwestern was watching him, with
the sagacious, estimating look of the hard-headed
business man.</p>

<p>For a long moment, both men eyed each other
steadily. Then a cynical smile parted the broker’s
lips.</p>

<p>“Assuming that you’ll buy it, Mr. Sangerly, may
I ask what you propose doing with it—particularly
when you realize that your purchase of the
Huntington ranch means our absolute refusal to
grant your company right of way privileges across
the Lucky Boy ground into Geerusalem?” He
paused, his smile vanishing, his eyes narrowing
as he disclosed his hand. “And right here, let me
say that you may consider our negotiations held
up pending the complete settlement of the Huntington
scandal and the final disposition of this
ranch.”</p>

<p>Harrison, sitting in an obscure corner of the
room, caught his breath, amazed at his master’s
rash move. Sangerly represented a powerful corporation.</p>

<p>The railroad manager chuckled deep down in his
throat. Open opposition and threat were what he
delighted to cope with; and in the present case
it was simply a matter of outwitting the enemy
with its own knowledge of facts.</p>

<p>“Since you have taken such a bold stand in this
thing, why not go on and tell us your underlying
motive, Mr. Quintell? Why not enlighten us, for
instance, with the information that, having learned
of an immensely rich gold strike on the land owned
by Miss Huntington’s father, you are reaching out
after it—trying to get possession by methods not
much better than those employed by your rascally
friend, the claim jumper?”</p>

<p>Quintell sprang from his chair with an oath.
His face was drawn with fury. He took one step
toward Mr. Sangerly, then halted irresolutely.</p>

<p>Dot stared at the speaker in blank astonishment.
Lex had risen and stood watching Quintell, while
Harrison made preparations to go to his employer’s
assistance at the first sign of trouble.</p>

<p>The elder Sangerly, now got deliberately to his
feet. He pointed an authoritative finger at the boss
of Geerusalem and shot out in sharp tones: “I’m
buying that ranch, Quintell. You may consider
the right of way negotiations ended, absolutely.
There’ll be no M. &amp; S. terminal in Geerusalem. If
Geerusalem wishes to do business with my road, it
can haul its freight and stage its passengers to
and from our trains. If we can’t do any better,
we’ll erect our depot and establish our yards on
the Huntington ranch, and you people can bridge
the four-mile gap the best way you see fit——”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can, can we?” broke in Quintell nastily.
“Let me tell you something, Sangerly! You just
start that Hawthorne, Nevada, game of giving this
town the go-by, and I’ll see that your gangs’ll never
drive another spike.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take that challenge,” said the other. “And
now, let me tell <i>you</i> something. The Billy Geerusalem
claims are so rich that the new camp of
Liggs, that I propose to start on the Huntington
ranch, will be the metropolis of Soapweed Plains
inside of a month. Do you happen to know Mrs.
Agatha Liggs?”</p>

<p>Quintell did not reply. There was a crafty, triumphant
glint in his eyes that somehow did not
blend with his uncertainty of manner.</p>

<p>“Well, I do,” went on Lex’s father. “And I’ve
had a talk with her. That’s how I know why you
want that ranch. That’s why you’ll never get it,
Quintell. Do you know who owns the <i>Searchlight</i>
now?”</p>

<p>Here, the broker found an opening. He had regained
much of his poise. “I always get what I
go after, Sangerly,” he said grimly. “Buy, and I
start legal action. You’re not dealing with a hick,
don’t forget that! I have deeds showing transfer
of those mining claims by the locators—the original
locators. I’ll tie your operations up by injunction,
as tight as a drum.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sangerly fixed his steely eyes on him. “Was
one of those original locators Jerome Liggs?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Jerome Liggs is a criminal at large—wanted for
the robbery of the Marysville city treasury. I don’t
deal with criminals except to notify the sheriff,
and——” He broke off.</p>

<p>Standing facing the door leading into the hall,
a movement of one of the portières attracted his
eye. He stared at the gleaming barrel of a six-shooter
that suddenly flashed into view, covering
him, and at the tall, slim figure of the man back
of it. His eyes widened, remained fixed in fearful
fascination on the newcomer.</p>

<p>The latter advanced into the room and paused a
few steps away from the broker. His glance swept
the room. It rested a moment on Dot and returned
to Quintell. The boss of Geerusalem paled,
crumpled under it. Dot’s breath came fast, and a
blush rose to her cheeks as her eyes rested, for
the second time that day, on the hero of her
romantic dreams.</p>

<p>“I’m Billy Gee, Miles,” said the outlaw laconically,
gazing steadily at Quintell.</p>

  CHAPTER XXIII—THE UPRISING
</h2>

<p>“You don’t look awful glad to see an old friend,
Miles,” said Billy Gee suavely, after a short
pause. “An’ so you’re Jule Quintell, the boss of
Geerusalem, I’ve heerd so much about, eh? They
tell me you bin runnin’ things to suit yoreself, an’
gettin’ away with it. Like you got away with it
that other time, eh, Miles? Oh, Pete!” he called
out suddenly. “Come on in an’ see who’s here!”</p>

<p>Out of the hall behind him trotted Tinnemaha
Pete. He stopped, squinting at the visitors.</p>

<p>“Oho! If it ain’t you, Dot! What’re ye doin’—an’
Mr. Spangaree, or I’m a liar! That’s yore ol’
man, ain’t it?” His glance fell on Quintell, then
he shuffled up to him and peered boldly into his
face. “Billy,” he burst out, giggling, “you ol’
son-of-a-gun, you ketched him! Kill him! Go on
an’ kill him——”</p>

<p>The outlaw raised his hand restrainingly. “I
bin watchin’ around for you ever since that time,
Miles,” he said, addressing the broker. “I oughter
shoot you, jest like Pete says. Folks think I’m a
pretty tough cuss. Mebby I am. Anyhow, I’m
puttin’ you over the hurdles. Now, you tell these
people the name you know me by. Go on!”</p>

<p>“His—Jerome Liggs,” faltered Quintell, with an
effort.</p>

<p>“Jerome!” gasped Lex. He took a quick step
toward the bandit and stared at him with wide
eyes. The elder Sangerly frowned bewilderedly.
The man who had, for three years, rifled the trains
of the M. &amp; S.!</p>

<p>“Now, Miles, tell ’em what you done to the
Lucky Boy claims last night!” went on Billy Gee
grimly. He jammed the menacing six-shooter into
the man’s midriff. “Tell ’em how you salted ’em—everything!”</p>

<p>While the broker began in a reluctant, hesitating
voice, Harrison edged quietly out of the room.
He sped out through the back door of the bungalow
and thence down the dark hillside, racing like mad
for the main street to arouse the camp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Miles, alias Jule Quintell, confessed.
His audacity, self-assurance, arrogance, vanished
with that confession. Confronting him, holding him
at the point of a gun, was a man who held a long-standing
grudge against him, none other than the
notorious desperado, Billy Gee, the man on whom
he had shunted the crime of robbing the Marysville
city treasury.</p>

<p>Billy Gee now turned to Dot and the two Sangerlys.
“Folks,” he said evenly. “Miles here jest
told you that Jerome Liggs robbed the Marysville
city treasury. That’s why I’m Billy Gee. To-night
I’m turnin’ him over to Sheriff Warburton, an’ Tinnemaha
Pete—who used to be janitor of the Marysville
city hall—he’ll swear he saw Treasurer Miles
actin’ mighty suspicious in his office, round one
o’clock one night.”</p>

<p>“Will I? Will I?” cried the old desert rat jubilantly.
“Reckillect, Billy, what I told you? I seen
him puttin’ a package——Kill him, Billy! Why
don’t you go on an’ kill him! Don’t be a damn
fool! D’ye hear?”</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, the door of Quintell’s desert
mansion opened, and its owner stepped onto the
veranda. Behind him came Billy Gee, followed by
the rest. They set out down the terraced grounds
for the street—a strange procession surely, five
men and a girl. Dot reached the outlaw’s side
and touched his arm.</p>

<p>“Jerome,” she whispered. “I’m afraid. You
must not take the risk. You must not meet Sheriff
Warburton. He’s looking for you. Don’t you understand,
Jerome?” There was a little catch in
her voice.</p>

<p>“There’s no need worryin’,” he replied. “If I
have to skip out sudden tell Lex I want to see
him at the ranch the furst thing in the mornin’.
An’ you come along, won’t you? That other chap
musta sneaked out after help, but we’ll fool him,”
he added.</p>

<p>She kept pace with him, Quintell moodily plodding
on before them. Once she looked up at Billy
Gee. There were fine lines in his face, she thought,
despite the fact that she could only just make out
his features in the uncertain light reflecting from
the business thoroughfares, some blocks away.
Presently, she found herself thrilling over the realization
that she was walking beside a popularly
supposed “bad man” in action, one who, through her
influence, had abandoned his lawless career to get
back into the ranks of the law-abiding. But the
strange surge of pride she felt was fleeting. The
utter hopelessness of the effort struck her with
full force. He was a fugitive. He would remain
a fugitive until he was captured; even now, Sheriff
Warburton was in the country to capture him.
Again, she laid her hand on his arm—clutched it.</p>

<p>“Jerome, please! For—for my sake, Jerome, don’t
meet Warburton. Let this wretch go. It is too
late for revenge. Please—Jerome!” she urged
wildly.</p>

<p>He looked down at her and smiled. He opened
his mouth to speak but the words were never
uttered. A deafening explosion on the main street
ahead, broke horribly on the still night, shook the
ground under their feet, and brought them to a
sudden halt. Quintell, seizing the opportunity to
escape, started forward, then stopped in his tracks
as his captor’s revolver prodded him in the back.</p>

<p>At that moment, a two-story stone building
standing in the brilliantly illuminated center of the
camp crumpled before their eyes, crashed into
ruins with a muffled roar. A great cloud of dust
shot into the air.</p>

<p>“The <i>Searchlight</i>! They’ve—they’ve dynamited
the <i>Searchlight</i>!” cried Lex aghast.</p>

<p>“Good heaven!” burst out the elder Sangerly.
“Babcock—the men, Lex! They might have been
at work—some of them.” A furious cry broke
from him. He sprang at Quintell and caught him
by the throat. “You devil!” he panted. “Not
content with trying to rob us, you destroy our
property—the newspaper we wrested from your
filthy clutches. You miserable——”</p>

<p>“Father!” Lex dragged the other back forcibly.
“Listen! This is no time for that sort of thing.
We are in danger, without making matters worse.
The camp is backing him, backing him to a man.”</p>

<p>Quintell overheard him. “I’m glad you appreciate
that fact, Mr. Sangerly,” he remarked with a
harsh chuckle. “If I may be permitted to say it,
you’re all in imminent danger of your lives. I
would advise you to see that I’m set free. Otherwise,
I won’t be responsible for consequences.
This man is a criminal. It is ridiculous to believe
that he will turn me over to the sheriff—to the
very man who is looking for him. He’s bluffing.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” said Billy Gee curtly.
“Come on—get a-goin’! If yore friends start shootin’,
so do I. I’ve bin waitin’ for this chance too
long, Miles. I’m goin’ through with it now. Better
you take the sidewalk, Dot,” he added gently.
“There’s trouble comin’, I reckon. Tell Lex to
hurry on ahead to the Miners’ Hotel an’ notify
Warburton we’re on our way. He’ll know where
to meet us. Take down this back street, Miles,
an’ watch yore step!”</p>

<p>The street he indicated was a deserted back
thoroughfare paralleling the main one of the camp.
The rear of the Miners’ Hotel faced it, and a little
distance farther on, was the gate leading into the
yard back of the dry-goods store through which
Billy Gee had flitted on many a midnight to visit
his mother.</p>

<p>With Quintell obeying the outlaw’s command, the
group turned to enter the side street. Their footfalls
rang out sharply on the rocky ground. Following
the explosion, a profound silence had fallen
on the settlement, broken only by the sound of
galloping hoofs as Warburton’s deputies dashed for
the scene of destruction.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wild shout rose out of the gloom
of the side street. It swelled into a roar, coming
from all directions. In a twinkling, the thoroughfare
became alive with men, pouring from every
conceivable hiding place in the vicinity. Lex and
his father cried out a warning. The former caught
Dot by the arm.</p>

<p>“Come! Run! They’ll trample us!” he shouted.</p>

<p>But she shook him off, her eyes flashing with a
resolute fire. “I’m all right. Take care of your
father and Pete. Get them away!” Her voice was
harsh, commanding.</p>

<p>The outlaw gave a short laugh. Lex hesitated
an instant, then started off on a run for the sidewalk,
dragging his father with him. They collided
with the onrushing horde of furious men and
went wallowing. Tinnemaha Pete, his old brain
grasping the peril of the situation at the first
alarm, escaped the crush and fled like mad for
the Miners’ Hotel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Billy Gee’s disengaged hand had
fastened on Quintell’s coat collar. He jerked the
boss around out of the treacherous darkness and
headed him for the brilliantly lighted main street,
a block away. His six-shooter was boring into
his prisoner’s back, cutting into the flesh.</p>

<p>“Talk to ’em, Miles!” he hissed into the other’s
ear. “Talk to ’em fast, Miles, or I let go!”</p>

<p>Quintell put up a trembling hand. His face was
ashen, drawn with fear. “Men, he’s got me. Stop,
men! He’s got me! Can’t you see? Stand back!
For God’s sake, men, stand back!” he panted
wildly.</p>

<p>The mob halted its forward rush—frenzied, baffled.
It circled just out of arm’s reach of the
trio, a solid mass of surging, lawless humanity that
itched for the letting of blood, gripping their murderous
weapons, filling the night with their cries
and curses. Like stampeded cattle, they milled and
strained around the three, shouting their foul threats
and insults at the girl and the outlaw, reassuring
their master, waiting with wolfish eagerness for the
moment when they could fall upon their prey and
destroy it.</p>

<p>“Fellers,” proclaimed Billy Gee, his tones cool
and deliberate, “this here is a personal matter
’twixt me an’ him. His name ain’t Quintell. It’s
Gene Miles. He robbed the Marysville city treasury
three years ago an’ laid the job on me. Gangway,
men, gangway!” he added, starting Quintell
onward.</p>

<p>“He lies! He lies!” cried Harrison, shouldering
his way to the front. “This is Billy Gee, the
bandit. He held us up—burglarized Jule Quintell’s
home. He’s taking him down to the office to make
him open the safe. Are you going to let him get
away with it, men? Are you letting him pull off
this rough stuff before your eyes, in a civilized
community? One man against a thousand? Are
you going to stand for——”</p>

<p>“Talk to ’em, Miles! Talk to ’em!” threatened
Billy Gee. “Tell ’em to fall back an’ let us
through. You’ll go before I do, Miles. I got a
bead on yore heart. I’ll be good for one bullet—maybe
more.”</p>

<p>Again, the broker called on that frantic crowd,
supplicated it vehemently in an agony of terror.
Snarling its hatred, its ranks parted grudgingly,
then closed in behind where Dot brought up the
rear with Billy Gee’s other revolver tight gripped
in her hand.</p>

<p>Carried away by the desperateness of the outlaw’s
plight, Dot had whisked the six-shooter from
the holster of her romantic hero, resolved to back
him in his fight, to perish with him, if necessary.
Just now, she kept her gun trained on the bank
of vicious faces that crowded after her. There
was a fire in her eyes and a determination on her
pretty face, far more eloquent than any words.</p>

<p>They turned into the main street finally, and
continued on down, moving slowly, the multitude
pressing in on them, raging around them, menacing
them still. They passed the great heap of
débris which had once represented the home of the
Geerusalem <i>Searchlight</i>. As they reached the corner,
out of the cross street dashed a troop of cow-punchers,
with Sheriff Warburton at their head.
Others followed, thundering down upon the mob
from front and rear, scores of the grim-faced
riders of the range waiting only for the signal to
open fire on the enemy.</p>

<p>“Men of Geerusalem, as sheriff of San Buenaventura
County, I order you to disperse!” shouted
Warburton in ominous tones.</p>

<p>The mob halted. It stood hemmed in by mounted
men, surrender being the only alternative left it,
save that of bloody resistance. There was a tense,
heavy silence.</p>

<p>Billy Gee, followed by Dot, thrust Quintell forward
until he stood at the sheriff’s stirrup.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Billy!” said Warburton curtly.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Bob!” replied Billy Gee. “Here’s yore man.
What d’you want done with him?”</p>

<p>“Herd him on down to the hotel, an’ I’ll——”</p>

<p>“This is an outrage, sheriff,” broke from Quintell.</p>

<p>“Collusion!” cried Harrison, at the top of his
lungs. “Warburton, I demand the arrest of Billy
Gee, notorious outlaw and criminal at large. Men,
they’re in cahoots! It’s a frame-up! A political
frame-up!”</p>

<p>A sudden wave of fury swept over the massed
body of the mob. Big George Rankin’s face glared
murderously for one instant out of its depths.</p>

<p>“Altogether, gang! Give the cow-chasers hell!”
he yelled, opening fire on the nearest riders as he
spoke.</p>

<p>In a twinkling, the battle was on. The street
was converted into a bloody arena reverberating
with the roar of blazing six-shooters and the shouts
and curses of frenzied men. Taking advantage of
the moment, Billy Gee thrust Dot in front of him,
and with Quintell leading the way, fled in a hail
of bullets for the Miners’ Hotel. The conflict raged
on fiercely, the mob fighting with desperate abandon
to break through the cordon of mounted deputies.
Up and down the main street dashed terrified
horses, riderless. Other cow-punchers, thirsting to
avenge their fellows’ deaths, filled up the ranks.
The street became littered with dead and dying.
Stubbornly, furiously, the Quintell element fought.
Then Big George Rankin passed out, a curse on
his lips.</p>

<p>Sheriff Warburton raised his voice over the
tumult:</p>

<p>“Las Animas an’ Bar-G men, close in there!
Ride ’em down!”</p>

<p>The two cow-puncher outfits swung into line and
set spurs to their horses. Into the mob they drove,
head on, hurling it back, trampling its members
under hoof. Like some irresistible tide, they swept
on recklessly, fatally; and the rioters began to
give way, to retreat, slowly at first, then with increasing
haste, before the savage advance. Presently
they broke and fled for the security of the
sidewalks, pouring into saloon and dance hall and
gambling den, availing themselves of every means
of escape. The street cleared as if by magic. In
the dust lay the dead, Big George Rankin and
Harrison among them. Through the camp sped
bodies of horsemen bearing the sinister message:</p>

<p>“Lights out! Keep inside or be shot on sight!”</p>

<p>Warburton, bleeding from a nasty scalp wound,
reached the hotel finally. He was in a fiery mood.
He rushed Quintell upstairs to a room, handcuffed
him, and put a guard over him. Then he came
down again, wiping the blood from the side of his
face, and walked over to where Billy Gee and Dot
were standing.</p>

<p>“You know what we agreed, Billy? I got to git
patched up an’ I’ll be busy most o’ the night,” he
said tersely.</p>

<p>The outlaw nodded. “I’m goin’ out to the Huntington
ranch to-night, Bob. The agreement stands.”</p>

<p>“You kin expect me there round noon, Billy,”
said Warburton, turning away.</p>

<p>“You’ll find me waitin’, sheriff.”</p>

<p>“Send them cow-punchers in. Tell ’em to report
here.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, a hostler brought two saddle
horses up to the hotel entrance. Lex Sangerly and
his father stood on the sidewalk along with Mrs.
Liggs, and watched as Billy Gee and Dot mounted
and rode down the quiet street, bound for the
lonely, desolate ranch on Soapweed Plains. Mrs.
Liggs was weeping disconsolately into her handkerchief,
a pathetic little figure, bent and broken
with a sorrow she had never earned.</p>

<p>The moon was just rising, flooding the gaunt
land with its soft, compassionate glow. There was
a subtle charm in that desert realm; a strange
beauty in the night. But Dot was oblivious to
these enchantments, ideal though they were for
tender words of love, for the delicious ecstasies
of that first embrace, that first kiss. Her heart was
brimful of grief, weighed down with an overwhelming
sadness greater than she had ever known.
Billy Gee was surrendering to the law in the
morning. He was passing out of her life, forever.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 title='XXIV—Warburton Gets Square' id='chXXIV'>
  CHAPTER XXIV—WARBURTON GETS SQUARE
</h2>

<p>Walking their horses down Geerusalem Gulch,
they went, riding side by side. Neither
spoke. They passed the lonely, dilapidated rock
hut where Lennox, wounded, had applied for help
on that exciting night of his flight from camp, and
crossed the monumented gravel bar that was to be
known thereafter as Quintell’s Unlucky Boy. Ahead
of them spread the great, gray floor of Soapweed
Plains, looking under the sheen of the moon like
some placid ghostly sea. From out of the immeasurable
distances came the pitiful howl of a wild
dog foraging hopelessly for food.</p>

<p>As they reached the point in the gulch where
it began to spill its rocky bottom over the bosom
of the plains, Dot turned her head and looked at
Billy Gee. Her face was pale, her lips drawn.</p>

<p>“Why did you ever do it, Jerome?” she asked
in dead tones.</p>

<p>He bent a sharp glance at her. Her cheeks shone
wet in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“I’m glad now I did, Dot,” he said simply. “But
he had me dead to rights—arrested. I couldn’t
help it. It was my only way out. An’ I wanted
to save you folks, an’ there was Lex bein’ swindled
on that placer proposition. I wouldn’t stand
for——”</p>

<p>“How did you know?”</p>

<p>“I seen him. It was right out yonder,” he said,
pointing back up the wash where he had overheard
Quintell and Harrison discussing the salting of
the Lucky Boy group the night before. He explained
the incident briefly to her. “He lit a
match, an’ I got a look at his face an’ knowed
him. You can’t ever guess how I felt about it,
Dot,” he went on, in a harsh voice. “Here was
the man who had made me a bandit, the man I
bin huntin’ and huntin’ for three years. When he
planted that evidence against me to clear himself
an’ make me out the thief, I was one of his clerks,
an’ I’d already bin talked about to run against
him at the next election. That’s why he done it,
I reckon. Well, it’s all over now.”</p>

<p>“But Pete knew all about it. Oh, Jerome, why
didn’t you let him swear out a warrant for Quintell’s
arrest!” cried Dot miserably.</p>

<p>“Poor ol’ Pete! He’s scary an’ funny, an’ more’n
likely they’d think he was jest imaginin’ things.
No, Dot! It’s better the way it turned out.” He
paused, then continued in slow, plaintive tones:
“After I got away from them night riders this
mornin’, I kept lookin’ back. I was afraid they’d
drop in at the ranch ag’in—an’ my mother was
there. An’—well, you was out yonder, too, Dot.
Anyway, I was worried an’ wasn’t watchin’ for
Warburton. That’s how he come to git me.</p>

<p>“He took me over to Blue Mud Spring, an’ me
an’ him an’ yore dad rode back to the ranch together.
Then I told him about the Marysville robbery,
an’ Pete tells his story of how he seen Miles
leavin’ the city hall with a valise, round one
o’clock, the night before the robbery. There was
a lot more said, for instance, how Miles, or Quintell,
as he calls himself, was tryin’ to drive you
folks out o’ the country, an’ how he’d salted these
claims to hold up the railroad comp’ny. Then I
got the idea to git Miles, myself. I told Warburton
I figgered that much was comin’ to me, seein’
as how Miles had made me a criminal. Yore dad
took sides with me, Dot. Yes, he did. An’ Warburton
agreed. He put me on my honor.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Everything’s turned out dandy.
An’ the Billy Geerusalem claims is goin’ to be split
three ways, between Pete, my mother, an’ yore
dad. That’s all bin fixed, Dot, an’ better days are
comin’.”</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, he reached out suddenly,
and his hand closed hard over hers. Her face was
averted, streaming with silent tears. She was gazing
mutely toward the boundless stretches of desolation
beyond which lay the now invisible violet and
yellow scallop of range that had formed the background
of all her past romantic dreams. She faced
him suddenly, a sob bursting from her, clutching
his hand spasmodically.</p>

<p>“It’s not too late, Jerome. It’s not too late,” she
cried. “You can escape. You have to! He must
not take you. Do you know what it’ll mean? The
penitentiary for life! Dear God! Never to get
free! To count the long, long years passing, to
grow old and wasted, to die and find your freedom
in the grave. Jerome, he must not take you.
You owe it to yourself, to your mother, to me!
Jerome, for my sake, if for no other reason!”</p>

<p>She jerked her horse to an abrupt stop. Gone
was her restraint. She was weeping passionately,
appealingly, with hysterical abandon. He reined in
beside her, leaned out of the saddle, caught her
in his arms, and drew her to him. His breath was
coming from him in great gasps.</p>

<p>“Dot—darling!” he choked hoarsely.</p>

<p>Her heart opened then, and she poured into his
ear the strength of her love for him, all her secret
hopes, her fears, her mounting despair, in one
desperate outpouring of entreaty.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember, Jerome, dearest?” she
sobbed distractedly. “‘You poor, wounded wild
animal,’ I called you. I wanted you then. You
wandered out of my dreamland, a part of my
dreams. You came living—dying, to me. You
belonged to me. You belong to me now—now that
my heart is breaking for you, dear.” She stroked
his face fiercely with her hands. “To-night, I’ll
speak to father. You must be on your way to the
Mexican border by midnight. We’ll sell the ranch
and the claims and follow, with your mother as
soon as——”</p>

<p>She broke off. Through the dead silence, bearing
down on them from the rear, came the sound
of mad hoofs, the pop of a quirt against an animal’s
flanks mingling with the wild, weird cries
of a man. Then, into view loomed a diminutive
rider. It was Tinnemaha Pete astride one of his
little burros. Like some grotesque goblin of the
night he came speeding up to them, cackling and
sputtering incoherently.</p>

<p>“They tell me ye give up—quit like a dollar
watch. Quit like a——” he screeched insanely,
jerking his puffing burro to a stop. “Say it’s
a danged lie, Billy! Billy, d’ye hear? Don’t tell
me ye ain’t got the guts. Don’t tell me, my Billy
boy ain’t got the guts. The son of Agatha! D’ye
mark that, Dot? D’ye want—d’ye want to—d’ye
want to kill me, Billy? To know—to know the
buzzards’ll be peckin’ my innards outer me, sooner’n
they oughter?”</p>

<p>He waved his skinny arms, a curious spasm of
emotion sweeping over him, racking his shriveled
little body.</p>

<p>“Jerome, did you hear? Oh, how can you refuse?
How can you——&#160;And Sheriff Warburton would
understand. He is so good and generous. Please,
Jerome, darling! Do as I say,” pleaded Dot passionately.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when Lemuel Huntington
admitted them. Dot was pale and drawn of
face, her eyes filled with suffering. Tinnemaha
Pete puffed furiously at his old pipe and muttered
endlessly to himself. Billy Gee sat down, bowed his
head, and stared at the floor. Presently the girl
brought up a chair and, taking her place close
beside him, leaned her cheek against his arm and
wept.</p>

<p>Lemuel, clad in an old-fashioned night robe, stood
and blinked at them soberly. Throughout that day
he had been repairing, where he could, the damage
wrought by the night riders, so that, lacking certain
pieces of furniture destroyed beyond all hope
of restoration, the interior of the house looked
much the same as it always had.</p>

<p>Standing thus, watching the trio, he presently
nodded gravely to himself; for he recalled the
agreement Billy Gee had entered into with Bob
Warburton, and he knew without being told that
Jule Quintell’s activities were at an end. Moreover,
he was witnessing the verification of a long-standing
suspicion that his Dot was in love with
this outlaw. Without a word, he tiptoed into the
little closet where Lennox lay and closed the door
after him.</p>

<p>“It’s hell,” he whispered to the mining engineer,
after they had discussed the situation. “But she’ll
ferget it, soon’s she gits back to her edjucation.
That’s one blessing. But ain’t it too bad, Lennox?
You see, he saved my life to-day, when them kiyotes
were takin’ me——”</p>

<p>“He saved mine, too,” broke in the other with
a sigh.</p>

<p class='mt10'>The next day dawned finally. The sun rose,
gloriously bright, and a playful little breeze came
frolicking merrily out of the northwest. A lone
mocking bird had lingered for one whole hour in
the elderberry tree in the garden, pouring out a
beautiful pæan, heralding to the desolate world its
love of life and freedom.</p>

<p>Billy Gee was still at the ranch. He sat on
the front porch with Dot. They sat facing the
distant island of chromatic hills where nestled the
camp of Geerusalem, watching the white thread of
road that led to it. Sheriff Warburton would come
by that road. Now and again, the girl would
moan pitifully and wring her hands in silent agony.
Every little while, Billy Gee would clasp her close,
and he would kiss her hungrily and whisper fierce
words of endearment into her ear.</p>

<p>Seated on a bench at one end of the porch, was
Tinnemaha Pete. Like a faithful dog grown old
and purblind and helpless, he kept his rheumy eyes
riveted on this youthful partner of his who was
determined to keep his promise with the “keys of
the penitentiary.” Never, never had Tinnemaha
Pete felt so broken-hearted, so near death, so
desperate. A dark, awful resolution had found
a sanctuary in his fanatical old brain. In the
back pocket of his voluminous overalls lay a loaded
revolver.</p>

<p>“An’ they kin hang me after,” he murmured to
himself, over and over. “An’ they kin hang me
after. I’ve lived long enough—what? He ain’t.
An’ they kin hang me after. Betcha life, they kin—an’
I’ll laugh at ’em.”</p>

<p>From the direction of the barn came the sounds
of Lemuel’s hammer, restoring the ravages of the
mob. He was unusually solemn and thoughtful.
Presently he threw down the hammer and perched
himself on the top rail of the corral and watched
the road to Geerusalem.</p>

<p>The hours dragged by, heavy, tragic hours.
Eight, nine, ten, eleven o’clock came and went. At
half past eleven, an automobile suddenly made its
appearance out of the far-away island of hills. It
approached at a wild rate. The driver proved to
be Lex Sangerly—alone. He brought the car to
a stop, leaped out and dashed up to the front porch.
Tinnemaha Pete got to his feet and one clawlike
hand reached into his overalls pocket.</p>

<p>“Compliments from Sheriff Warburton,” cried
Lex jubilantly. “He’s attending to some official
business and couldn’t get here at the appointed
hour. He asked me to deliver this message to
Jerome Liggs.” He flourished a yellow sheet of
paper, a telegram, which he read aloud as Lemuel
came hurrying up:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>“<span class='sc'>L. S. Sangerly, senior</span>, Manager M. &amp; S. R. R.</div>
<p>“Your wire relative to Billy Gee’s parole considered and
approved. Withdrawal of charges against him by your
company and your personal concern in his case make me
feel keenly interested in his redemption. Your views are
directly in line with my own. As you must know I am
inaugurating the honor system in the penal institutions of
this State. Kindest regards to yourself and family. I am
informing the sheriff of San Buenaventura County of my
action.</p>
<div class='tar'>
“<span class='sc'>Hiram Bronson</span>, Governor,</div>
<div class='tar'>“State of California.”</div>
</blockquote>

<p>A hysterical cry of joy burst from Dot. Tinnemaha
Pete dropped the revolver back into his
pocket and staggered blindly to the bench and made
curious, choking noises in his throat.</p>

<p>Later that day, while Lemuel sat smoking on the
porch and grinning contentedly to himself, Billy
Gee came out of the house and confronted him.</p>

<p>“Huntington!” he said shortly. “You reckillect
that mornin’ I told you I was goin’ to pay you
back for sellin’ me out to Sheriff Warburton?”</p>

<p>The rancher took his pipe from his mouth and
stared soberly at the other. He did not reply.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re payin’, old sport. Me an’ Dot’s
goin’ to git married nex’ Sunday, whether you like
it or not. That’s how I square up with you.”</p>

<p>Before Lemuel could reply there was a heavy
footfall in the hall and a strident voice boomed
heartily:</p>

<p>“Hold on there, a minute, kid! I got somepn
to say about this.” They turned to see Sheriff
Warburton standing in the doorway, a bandage
around his head. Back of him stood Dot, her
pretty face wreathed in smiles. The sheriff got
out his handcuffs and approached the two men,
his eye on Billy Gee. Lemuel catching the meaning
of the action grinned broadly.</p>

<p>“I always told myself, that I’d hang these nickel-plated
doodads on you some time, young feller,”
said the sheriff gravely. “I’m goin’ to, right now—perticular
on account of what you jest said.
Come here, Dot!” He reached out and took the
girl by the arm and brought her alongside of Billy
Gee. With a deft movement, he handcuffed them
together. “After Sunday, Billy, that’s the awful
fix you’ll be in, an’ that’s how <i>I</i> square up with
<i>you</i>. He’s a lucky dog, Dot,” he added laughingly.</p>

<p>Tinnemaha Pete, watching the proceedings with
Mrs. Liggs, burst into a loud cackle of mirth.</p>

<p>“Son of a gun, Agatha! Did ye mark that? He
ain’t sech a measly skunk, as I thought he was.
What’re cryin’ about, Agatha?”</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m so happy, Pete,” she breathed, turning
away.</p>

<p>In the months that followed, the Huntington
ranch vanished, save for two fenced-in acres that
held the house, outbuildings, and the cool, old-fashioned
garden with the trim little grave in one
corner. The townsite of Liggs sprang up mushroomlike
and took its proud place on the map of
San Buenaventura County. The Billy Geerusalem
claims blossomed out, bonanzas, and the camp of
Geerusalem lost its ranking as the metropolis of
Soapweed Plains. It never knew a railroad—even
as the elder Sangerly had avowed to Jule Quintell,
now languishing in the State penitentiary.</p>

<p>Prosperity can never change the sterling members
of the human family, no more than may the
powers of alchemy convert slag into gold. They
are still the same humble dwellers of the vast
Mohave—Tinnemaha Pete, quaint, timid old desert
rat; Sheriff Bob Warburton, big of soul and purposeful;
achieving, ambitious Lex Sangerly; Dick
Lennox, mining engineer of merit.</p>

<p>The dark days of uncertainty still remain green
in the mind of Lemuel Huntington. They remain
green, too, in the mind of his daughter, whose
romantic brain worked out the destiny of her own
happiness. Nor can the shy little mother, who
lived and suffered for her wayward son, ever
forget; nor that son, who found the turning point
in the realization that the price for a hunted animal
could not tempt her compassionate heart.</p>

<p>All this and more has been narrated by Dot in
her novel, which she called “Billy Geerusalem,”
and lovingly dedicated to the man who came to
her out of the violet and yellow scallop of hills
which had formed the background of all her
romantic dreams.</p>
